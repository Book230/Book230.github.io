Credit One Charleston Open: Charleston, South Carolina: April 1st - April 7th,2024


		<img src="Charleston p2.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
The unseeded American won her 13th straight match and her second straight title with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over No.4 seed Daria Kasatkina in the Credit One Charleston Open final on Sunday.
World No.22 Collins needed just 1 hour and 17 minutes to dismiss 11th-ranked Kasatkina and back up her hard-court Miami Open title from last week with another crown on a different surface, green clay.
The last player to win Miami and Charleston in the same year was her fellow American Serena Williams in 2013 (Williams also pulled off the feat in 2008).
 With 13 straight match-wins, Collins' current run stands alone as the longest tour-level winning streak of her career. Her new personal record bests her 12-match win streak from 2021, which also spanned surfaces and included two straight titles (though not in back-to-back weeks).
In that 2021 run, Collins won in Palermo, Italy on clay, picked up the San Jose hard-court title a few weeks later in California (beating Kasatkina in the final, no less) and reached the Montreal Round of 16 before finally being stopped by Jessica Pegula.
Stat corner: Collins is now the fourth unseeded player to win the Charleston title, joining Iva Majoli in 2002, Justine Henin in 2005, and Kasatkina herself, who won her maiden WTA singles title in Charleston in 2017.
After her exploits in Miami and Charleston, former World No.7 Collins will likely be seeded at most, if not all of her events for the rest of her career, before her announced retirement later this season. Collins, who started February ranked World No.71, is projected to re-enter the Top 15 on Monday.
Krueger wouldn't be down and out for long. On Sunday, she teamed with fellow American Sloane Stephens to defeat Ukraine sisters Lyudmyla and Nadiia Kichenok 1-6, 6-3, 10-7 in the doubles final.

Open Internacional Femeni’ Solgirone’s: La Bisbal D'Empordà’,Spain: April 1st - April 7th,2024 
		<img src=" Cartell Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
No.6 seed Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina won the highest-level title of her career on Sunday, overcoming No.5 seed Rebeka Masarova of Spain 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 to capture the WTA 125 Open Internacional Femení Sol Gironès in La Bisbal d'Empordà, Spain.
Carle, currently ranked at a career-high World No.98, needed just under two hours to come back from a set down and topple homeland hope Masarova, the World No.91.
Carle had already made a WTA 125 singles final at the very end of last year, finishing runner-up to Laura Pigossi in Buenos Aires. She went one further on Sunday, converting nine of her 10 break points to take down Masarova.





With her first WTA 125 title, former Top 10 junior Carle hit a new milestone in a breakthrough season. The 24-year-old Carle cracked the Top 100 for the first time a month ago, and she also qualified for the Miami Open last month, making her WTA 1000 singles main-draw debut.
When Carle made her Top 100 debut on March 4, it became the first time in 16 years there has been more than one player from Argentina in the WTA singles Top 100. Nadia Podoroska is the Argentine No.1, currently ranked World No.67.
The La Bisbal d'Emporda doubles title went to the all-Czech pairing of Miriam Kolodziejova and Anna Siskova. They won the final via walkover after the Hungarian team of Timea Babos and Dalma Galfi withdrew in advance of the match, due to Galfi's right knee injury.
The Czechs were alternated into the main draw, getting in after the team of Harriet Dart and Greet Minnen withdrew. They took that opportunity all the way to the title, which is the first WTA 125 doubles title for Kolodziejova, and Siskova's second WTA 125 doubles title.

Copa Colsanitas Zurich: Bogotá Colombia: April 1st - April 7th,2024

Ranked No.85 and seeded No.6, Osorio enjoyed a resurgent week in Bogota. She came into her home event looking to win back-to-back matches for the first time this season. She went on to lose just one set en route to the title.
In addition to stopping the top seed on Sunday, the 22-year-old from Cucuta also ended No.2 seed and two-time defending champion Tatjana Maria's 14-match Bogota win streak in the quarterfinals.
Osorio came into Sunday's final looking for her first career win over No.42 Bouzkova. In fact, Osorio had yet to win more than 4 games in a match vs. the grinding Czech. Bouzkova was also playing her first final of the season, having booked her spot with wins over Rebecca Marino, Hailey Baptiste, Laura Siegemund and Kamilla Rakhimova. 
With the capacity crowd firmly rooted in her corner, Osorio rebounded from an early break to ease through the first set. She extended that lead to a set and a break at 2-0 in the second before Bouzkova worked her way back.
Bouzkova broke to level the set at 2-2 and the duo exchanged a pair of tough holds to stay level at 5-5. After a soft service game from Bouzkova handed Osorio the break and a chance to serve out the win at 6-5, the Czech engineered a gritty, scampering match-point save to stay in the match and converted her fourth break point to force a tiebreak.
Locked at 3-3 in the tiebreak, Osorio moved to 4-3 after smartly wrong-footing Bouzkova at the baseline. Bouzkova responded with her own intelligent play, sneaking into the net to feather away a forehand volley winner. But a backhand miss from Bouzkova gave Osorio Championship Points at 6-4. After a nervous double fault on the first, Osorio used her baseline power to drag Bouzkova corner to corner on Championship Point No.3 and sealed the win after 1 hour and 55 minutes.
Osorio finished the match with 26 winners to 27 unforced errors. Bouzkova hit 16 winners to 25 unforced errors.

Grand Prix Hassan 11: Marrakech, Morocco: April 1st - April 7th,2024

		<img src="Marracach Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten did not have to wait long for their new partnership to bring success on the ATP Tour.
The Finnish-British duo downed Alexander Erler and Lucas Miedler 3-6, 6-4, 10-4 on Saturday to win the Grand Prix Hassan II in their first tournament together. The fourth seeds won six of the final seven points of the match to clinch an 88-minute victory at the clay-court ATP 250 in Marrakech.
Heliovaara and Patten had not dropped a set en route to the championship match but were forced to rally from behind against the second-seeded Erler and Miedler. The pair saved four of five break points they faced in their comeback win, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
It was a fifth ATP Tour crown for the 34-year-old Heliovaara, who competed at the 2022 Nitto ATP Finals alongside Lloyd Glasspool. Meanwhile it was a maiden tour-level title for Patten, whose only previous ATP Tour championship match appearance came alongside Julian Cash in Houston in 2023.


Matteo Berrettini is back with a bang on the ATP Tour.
The Italian marched to the title in just his second tour-level event of the season on Sunday at the Grand Prix Hassan II, where he snapped Roberto Carballes Baena’s nine-match winning streak in Marrakech with a 7-5, 6-2 victory.
Berrettini produced a superb display of hitting in a high-quality championship match to lift his first trophy since his Queen’s Club victory in 2022. He notched two breaks of serve in each set, particularly raising his level in the second for a one-hour, 46-minute triumph at the clay-court ATP 250.
“I want to thank my team,” said Berrettini at the trophy ceremony. “It’s been a tough past couple of years, I would say, and thanks to them I was able to overcome all the tough moments. My body wasn’t allowing me to play, so it’s thanks to [them] that I am here.
"[I also want to thank] all the people that made my comeback possible. All my friends, my family, people that were with me all the times when I was sad and injured, and I didn’t think I could make it, so thank you very much.”
The 2021 Wimbledon finalist was playing just his third tournament back after missing six months with an ankle injury. He dropped only two sets all week in Marrakech, where he is the first Italian champion since 2006. The 27-year-old now owns eight ATP Tour titles.
The pivotal moment in Berrettini’s final win came after he had broken Carballes Baena to lead 6-5 in the opening set. The Spaniard looked set to reclaim the break immediately as he held three break points at 0/40, but Berrettini produced some huge serving to ward off the danger and claim the first set with five straight points.
It was largely one-way traffic from there as Berrettini showcased his full repertoire of skills in the second set. He struck his forehand cleanly and used drop shots to great effect, ultimately wrapping his victory having saved seven of eight break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
With his title run, the former World No. 6 Berrettini has also risen 51 spots to No. 84 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

		Millenium Estoril Open: Estoril, Portugal: April 1st - April 7th,2024

		<img src="Estoril Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

Not even the switch to the slower surface of clay can stop the serve of Hubert Hurkacz.
The Pole deployed his booming delivery to great effect Sunday at the Millennium Estoril Open, where he overcame Pedro Martinez 6-3, 6-4 in the championship match to lift his eighth ATP Tour title. Hurkacz sent down 15 aces in a classy one-hour, 27-minute display as he stepped into the winners’ circle at a tour-level event on clay for the first time.
“I’m so happy with my performance today,” said Hurkacz. “I’m proud that I found my serve and that definitely helped me a lot. Pedro is such a great competitor, an amazing battle last night. I needed to play really great tennis to compete with him and fortunately I did it.”

Hurkacz won 83 per cent (29/35) of points behind his first serve against Martinez, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He wrapped his 87-minute victory with an ace to extend his lead in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series to 3-0.
“Obviously it is something special to play in a final,” said Hurkacz after improving to 8-2 in ATP Tour finals. “There was such a great crowd, a great atmosphere and I just really appreciate all the support. It’s an amazing tournament and it was so fun to be here for a week.”
Hurkacz will on Monday rise two spots to a joint-career high No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings as a result of his Estoril title run. The 27-year-old will now be full of confidence as he heads to the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, where his opening opponent will be Jack Draper.
Despite the disappointment of his final defeat, Martinez can look back on a strong week in Estoril. He sealed the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking against World No. 8 Casper Ruud in the semi-finals, and is set to rise 17 spots to No. 60 on Monday.
 Gonzalo Escobar and Aleksandr Nedovyesov prevailed in a match of two distinct halves on Sunday to claim the trophy at the Millennium Estoril Open.
The Ecuadorian-Kazakhstani duo prevailed 7-5, 6-2 against Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul at the clay-court ATP 250 in Portugal. They crucially clinched an opening set featuring 20 break points and five breaks of serve before accelerating through the second for their third ATP Tour crown as a team.
“To play against those guys, it is always a battle, so we needed to be focused all the way through the match,” said Nedovyesov. “The first set was tricky, break points here and there, and we knew we were going to be tested all the way.
“We just needed to stay focused and stay together. Even though we were 5-1 up in the second, we lost a bit of concentration there, but we managed to finish it up on a good note.”


With their one-hour, 41-minute triumph, Escobar and Nedovyesov levelled their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Doumbia and Reboul at 1-1. The pair is now 11-6 in 2024, having also reached a championship match in February in Los Cabos.
“It’s definitely special,” said Escobar, who is now a six-time ATP Tour champion, of the Estoril win. “It’s one of my favorite places and my last tournament before becoming a father, so it’s definitely special. We are getting better as a team and that’s the most important thing.”

		Fayez Sarofim and Co. U.S. Men’s Clay Court Championship: Houston, U.S.: April 1st - April 7th,2024 


		<img src="Houston Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

With three titles together in 2024, Purcell/Thompson are now level with Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic for most of the season. Their latest run lifted them three places to ninth in the PIF ATP Doubles Teams Rankings.
Purcell is now a seven-time tour-level doubles champ, with all of those triumphs coming alongside a fellow Aussie. The Houston title is Thompson's fifth, all of which have come at the ATP 250 level.




Ben Shelton has won the second ATP title of his career in Houston, battling past countryman Frances Tiafoe in the final, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.
It’s Shelton’s first ATP title on clay—in fact, before this week, he had never even been to the quarterfinals of an ATP event on the surface, though last year was just his first full season on the tour.
Bryan, who now coaches Ben, played on the tour between 1989 and 1997, going as high as No. 55 on the ATP rankings in 1992—and he picked up two ATP titles in his career, both at the grass-court event in Newport and in back-to-back years, in 1991 and 1992.
And Ben just added the ATP 250 clay-court title in Houston to his triumph at the ATP 500 hard-court event in Tokyo last fall.
The only other father-son duo to both win multiple tour-level titles in the Open Era are the Dents. Phil Dent won three, at Sydney in 1971 then Brisbane and Sydney in 1979, and his son, Taylor, won four, at Newport in 2002 then Memphis, Bangkok and Moscow in 2003.

Ben's first two career titles have come on hard and clay, while Bryan's two career titles both came on grass.


The Sheltons and the Dents are two of four father-son duos to both win at least one career tour-level title in the Open Era.
Ramanathan and Ramesh Krishnan also achieved the feat, with Ramanathan winning one in the Open Era in Toronto in 1968 (though he won more pre-Open Era), then his son, Ramesh, winning eight.
And the Kordas are also on the list, with Petr winning 10 (including a Grand Slam title at the 1998 Australian Open) and his son, Sebastian, winning one so far in Parma, Italy in 2021. When Sebastian wins his second, the Kordas will join the Dents and the Sheltons.
