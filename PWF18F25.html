								WTA player to 2/18 to 2/25/24:Jasmine Paolini

							 Earlier in the week, Jasmine Paolini expressed the inspiration she has drawn from Jannik Sinner and his win at the Australian Open. She also spoke of the profound influence from Italy's Golden generation of women, including the likes of Flavia Pennetta, Francesca Schiavone, Roberta Vinci and her friend and mentor Sara Errani.


Paolini came into the 2024 season with modest goals. She has steadily improved year-over-year since breaking into the Top 100 in 2019 and began this season ranked No.30. Her goals for the year were modest. She wanted to be seeded at the Grand Slams and win a tournament. 

It's not even March and she's cleared both hurdles. 

"I'm focusing on the process, on improving my game, because I think that this is the key, to try to do better because I don't want to have too much high expectations because this is not good for me," Paolini said. "But my coach told me the goal this year is to win a tournament. I didn't expect was so early and such a big event."


Nothing could prepare Paolini for her week in Dubai. She was down a set and a break to No.11 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia in the first round. She went on to win that match and scored two more Top 30 wins over Maria Sakkari and Sorana Cirstea. After coming from a set and a break down in the final and overcoming a 5-3 deficit in the third set, Paolini will soar to a new career-high of No.14 on Monday. 

Paolini plans to celebrate her win with her family in Tuscany, a trip that is as much a reward as a celebration.
