Porsche Tennis Grand Prix: Stuggart,Germany: April 15th - April 21th,2024


		<img src="WTA Stuggart.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

STUTTGART, Germany -- World No.4 Elena Rybakina captured her third Hologic WTA Tour title of the year on Sunday after defeating No.27 Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-2 in the final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. 


Stuttgart is Rybakina's eighth career title and third on clay, following wins at 2023 Rome and 2019 Bucharest. The 24-year-old leaves Germany with the outright lead in titles this season, adding Stuttgart to a collection that includes Brisbane and Abu Dhabi. The victory over Kostyuk was her tour-leading 26th win of the season.

"I always believe in myself, of course, but it's not only depends on me," Rybakina said. "There is a lot of great players, tough opponents. But I know if I feel fresh, if I'm physically ready, healthy, I'm playing my game, of course I have all the chances to win a Grand Slam on any surface."


Playing in her fifth final of the season, Rybakina opened the match by breaking Kostyuk's serve and never looked back. With efficient serving, the tour's ace leader sealed the first set after just 30 minutes. She lost just one point behind her first serve (15 of 16) and did not face a break point. Rybakina won 30 points to Kostyuk's 17.

Rybakina came into Sunday's final after snapping World No.1 Iga Swiatek's 10-match win streak at Stuttgart, winning 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the semifinals. 

"I knew that I have to be focused from the beginning, and also, compare the match with Iga, it's a lot different," Rybakina said. "Marta is coming forward, trying to take the ball early. She moves well. But still, the speed is different, and I was focusing not to rush, also to try to open the angle."

Facing down a confident Rybakina turned out to be a bridge too far for Kostyuk, who engineered a groundbreaking week in Stuttgart to make her second final of the year. In the midst of the best season of her career, Kostyuk will rise to a new career-high ranking of No.21 on Monday. 

The 21-year-old Ukrainian came into Sunday having tallied three straight Top 10 wins, defeating No.7 Zheng Qinwen, and reigning Slam champions No.3 Coco Gauff, and No.9 Marketa Vondrousova. Her win over Zheng in the Round of 16 was a remarkable one. Kostyuk saved five match points in stunning fashion to oust the Australian Open finalist. 



"Every morning I didn't know what to expect from myself on the court today," Kostyuk said, "because really me being able to pull off this whole week and play an amazing tennis yesterday was something incredible and something I would never expect I can do.

"But today, obviously I was very nervous. I wanted to win a lot this one, and yeah, I think there were a lot of things together. Yeah, I just couldn't probably bear it anymore."

Coming into the final with a 1-1 record against Rybakina, Kostyuk could find no inroads against the World No.4. Kostyuk struck just six unforced errors in the first set, but Rybakina's baseline aggression extracted 16 forced errors. 

Rybakina continued her momentum in the second set to close out the win after 1 hour and 9 minutes. She finished the match unbroken, saving all three break points she faced.

Oieras Women's Open: Oeiras,Portugal: April 15th - April 21th,2024


		<img src="Oerias Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Dutchwoman Suzan Lamens won the first WTA 125 level title of her career on Sunday at the Oeiras Ladies Open with a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 comeback win over Denmark's Clara Tasuon. The 24-year-old had three match points in the second set, and later trailed 4-1 in the final set.


The 2-hour, 53-minute triumph was full of twists and turns. Lamens looked on course to ease to victory when she built a 6-4, 5-0 lead -- only to see Tauson win a staggering seven consecutive games to force a decider. All of Lamens' match points came in a five-deuce ninth game in which she initially trailed 0-40, and was also broken in a similar game at 5-5.

Tauson's momentum continued well into the decider, as her run of games won extended to 11 of the last 12 to earn a double-break advantage. A pair of double faults off the Dane's racquet in a subsequent service game helped spark Lamens' belief that she could turn the match around, she said.

“I'm still trying to believe what happened," Lamens said afterwards. "It was a crazy match ... It was a big rollercoaster. I'm very happy, but also a bit tired."

"At the beginning of the third set, I was still thinking about that a lot," she said of the lead she lost. "At 1-4, I was just telling myself to keep fighting. She was 5-0 down, so from 4-1, I could maybe also come back."


The victory for the 24-year-old Lamens, who hails from Rotterdam, is the latest in an in-form spring. In March, she won her first ITF World Tennis Tour title above W25 level at the W60 in Trnava, Slovakia, and her Portuguese breakthrough saw her beat a pair of seeds, as well as a former Top 10 player. 

Lamens beat No.9 seed Emiliana Arango of Colombia in the first round, and stopped the run of former World No.10 Kristina Mladenovic in emphatic fashion in the semifinals after dropping the first set. Lamens won the last 12 games of her 4-6, 6-0, 6-0 victory over the Frenchwoman, having not dropped a set in the tournament prior to that point.

Ranked No.163 coming into the event, Lamens will be at a new career-high of No.134 on Monday.

"My main goal is to get into the Top 100, which is getting closer and closer now," Lamens added. "My goal for this year was to win a bigger title ... so it's really nice."

Fourth seeded Tauson dropped 15 games in her first three matches against Carole Monnet, Nuria Parrizas Diaz and Potrugal's own Matilde Jorge before getting a walkover from No.1-seeded American Bernarda Pera in the semifinals. The American withdrew due to a neck injury.


Jorge, though, came away with the doubles title, as she and her sister Francisca teamed to topple second-seeded Mladenovic and Great Britain's Harriet Dart in the final, 6-0, 6-4.

The sisters didn't lose a set in their title run, which also included a 6-0, 6-3 win over fourth-seeded Brits Alicia Barnett and Freya Christie in the first round and a 6-3, 6-3 win over No. 1-seeded Czechs Miriam Kolodziejova and Anna Siskova in the quarterfinals.

Open Capfinances Rouen Metropole: Rouen, France: April 15th - April 21th,2024


		<img src="Rouen Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
No.6 seed Sloane Stephens of the United States battled to her eighth career Hologic WTA Tour singles title on Sunday, defeating unseeded Magda Linette of Poland 6-1, 2-6, 6-2 to win the inaugural WTA 250 Open Capfinances Rouen Métropole in Rouen, France.


Stephens needed 2 hours and 10 minutes to prevail in the final and capture her first WTA title in over two years. Prior to this week, the American's most recent final had occurred in February of 2022, when she won the WTA 250 Abierto Akron Zapopan title in Guadalajara.

Former World No.3 Stephens is now 4-0 against Linette, and the American also holds an 8-3 win-loss record in WTA singles finals. Stephens has now won five WTA 250 titles in her career, along with her Grand Slam title (2017 US Open), WTA 1000 title (2018 Miami) and WTA 500 title (2016 Charleston).


Tale of the match: Stephens had dropped her first set of the tournament to her fellow American Peyton Stearns 6-1, but after that, Stephens looked unstoppable en route to the final. She won her next eight sets of the week without losing more than three games in any of them.

Stephens brought that world-beating form into the opening set of Sunday's final. She reeled off six consecutive games to take the one-set lead, closing out the opener with a backhand winner.

However, in the second set, the pendulum swung the other way. Stephens netted a volley which would have given her a 2-1 lead, and Linette took control in the set from there, racking up five games in a row to lead 5-1.

Former Top 20 player Linette took the second set two games later -- the first set she had ever won off of Stephens in their four career meetings.


In the end, though, Stephens got back on track. A critical four-deuce game at 1-1 went the American's way without having to face a break point, and after getting through that tussle, Stephens took charge, earning a break for 3-1 after Linette sent a backhand miscue wide.

Stephens needed six chances to close out the final, losing serve from 40-0 up at 5-1, then missing out on her next two championship points at 5-2. But the American was able to hold on and grasp the trophy after one final Linette backhand flew wide.

Stephens got 81 percent of her first-serve points into play in the final, where she converted six of her 15 break points.

Tiriac Open: Bucharest, Romania: April 15th - April 21th,2024


		<img src="ATP Bucharest Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Marton Fucsovics is back in the winners’ circle.

The Hungarian earned his second ATP Tour title on Sunday when he defeated rising Argentine Mariano Navone 6-4, 7-5 in the final of the Tiriac Open.

Former champions at the Bucharest ATP 250 event, which was played for the first time since 2016, include David Ferrer, Gilles Simon, Grigor Dimitrov and Fernando Verdasco. Now Fucsovics’ name is on the list.

“It feels really good. It’s been a long time since I’ve won an ATP 250 tournament, so it’s a great feeling,” Fucsovics said. “I was working really hard for it. Today was a tough one, but I was fighting until the end.”


Also a tour-level champion in Geneva in 2018, Fucsovics defeated three of the top five seeds in Bucharest to emerge victorious. He overcame a tenacious Navone in a gruelling two hours and six minutes to lift the trophy.

It was a special week in Romania for the No. 82 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, who will climb to World No. 53 on Monday.

“At some point, I felt like playing at home,” Fucsovics said. “Thanks for everyone coming out and supporting me, supporting us. Thank you.”



Fucsovics, who six years ago became the first Hungarian tour-level titlist since Balazs Taroczy at Hilversum in 1982, lost just one set this week. But despite the straight-sets scoreline, the championship clash proved a tough battle.

The 32-year-old Fucsovics came out firing from the baseline to surge to a 4-0 lead. But Navone, who had not played a tour-level match before the season and reached his first ATP Tour final in February in Rio de Janeiro, dug into the red clay and clawed back on serve.

At 4-4, Navone held break point to fully seize the momentum, but Fucsovics moved forward and hit a short forehand volley to get out of trouble. In the next game, his Argentine opponent missed back-to-back inside-out forehands wide to relinquish the set.

Navone battled back in the second set, leading by a break and looking in good position to force a decider. But Fucsovics stormed back and raised his arms to celebrate after Navone missed a final shot long to end the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

The champion won 48 per cent of his return points and converted five of his eight break points according to Infosys ATP Stats.

The fifth-seeded Navone fell short of winning his first ATP Tour title, but he will crack the Top 50 Monday for the first time at World No. 41. The 23-year-old began the year at World No. 125.

Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul defeated Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten 6-3, 7-5 on Sunday to win the Tiriac Open in Bucharest.

The Frenchmen dropped just one set in the tournament to claim their second ATP Tour title of the season. They were also victorious in Montpellier and reached finals in Cordoba and Estoril.

Doumbia and Reboul are now in eighth place in the PIF ATP Doubles Teams Rankings as they try to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time.

The Bucharest champions saved all three break points they faced in the final against Heliovaara and Patten, who had won 11 consecutive matches at all levels entering the final.

BMW Open: Munich, Germany: April 15th - April 21th,2024


		<img src="BMW Open.jpg" alt="Germany" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>


Jan-Lennard Struff banished past championship-match heartache in style on Sunday at the BMW Open in Munich.

The German overcame World No. 15 Taylor Fritz 7-5, 6-3 to lift his maiden ATP Tour title at the clay-court ATP 250. The fourth-seeded Struff entered the final with an 0-3 record in tour-level finals, but he showed no sign of nerves in front of his home fans en route to sealing a 79-minute triumph.

“[It feels] unbelievable, and to do it on home soil is just incredible,” said Struff in his post-match interview. “I waited so long. I’m 33 years old and played so long on Tour. It’s just an amazing feeling to do it here in Germany.”


Aged 33 years and 11 months, Struff became the third-oldest first-time champion since the ATP Tour was established in 1990. The pivotal moments in Struff’s victory came in the first set, when he faced two set points on his own serve at 4-5, 15/40, and then another at 40/Ad. From there, the home favourite reeled off 11 points in a row to take the set.

Struff and Fritz’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash on clay was played out in damp, cold conditions. The temperature dropped as low as 3 degrees Celsius during the championship match but that did not prevent the German bringing some real fire to the court. Just as he had in his semi-final upset of second seed Holger Rune, Struff used his powerful forehand to dictate rallies against a similarly high-powered opponent.

The home favourite clinched his victory with a powerful smash before immediately raising his arms in celebration to his team. He converted five of 11 break points he earned against Fritz, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to complete a dominant week on home soil in which he did not drop a set.



With his triumph, Struff improved to 16-8 in Munich, where he also reached the final in 2021. The German’s other tour-level finals both came in 2023, when he lost to Carlos Alcaraz as a lucky loser in the Madrid championship match and held a match point against Frances Tiafoe in Stuttgart before also falling to defeat.

Struff will on Monday rise four spots to No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings as a result of his Munich title run, just three spots shy of his career high. He has the chance to add another trophy to his cabinet later on Sunday, when he takes to court alongside countryman Andreas Mies in the doubles final against Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti.

“One more to go. I hope we can go all the way in the final now," said Struff of the doubles final. "I played good tennis this week, I’m very happy. I beat good guys and I’m just unbelievably happy that I did it today.”
Jan-Lennard Struff began his Sunday at the BMW Open by winning the singles title, his first ATP Tour triumph. But Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti spoiled the home favourite's hopes of claiming doubles glory in Munich, too.

The Indian-French duo defeated German wild cards Andreas Mies and Struff 7-6(6), 7-6(6) to claim the ATP 250 crown.

Bhambri and Olivetti first teamed in Marrakech, where they reached the semi-finals. They went two steps further this week, battling through two Match Tie-breaks en route to the trophy. In the first round, they upset Monte-Carlo champions Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen.

Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell: Barcelona, Spain: April 15th - April 21th,2024


		<img src="Barcelona Open.jpg" alt="Spain" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni won their second title of the season Sunday when they battled past Hugo Nys and Jan Zielinski 4-6, 6-4, 11-9 in the final of the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell.

The Argentines arrived in Spain having lost four of their past five matches. But the veterans found their form to emerge victorious at the ATP 500 event.

Gonzalez and Molteni beat a who’s who of opponents en route to the trophy, eliminating Australian Open finalists Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori, 2020 Nitto ATP Finals champions Wesley Koolhof/Nikola Mektic, this year’s Hong Kong champions Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic and Nys/Zielinski, who triumphed in Acapulco this year.

Gonzalez and Molteni saved seven of the 10 break points they faced and won 44 per cent of their first-serve return points according to Infosys ATP Stats. They lifted the trophy after one hour and 55 minutes, adding to their Cordoba crown.

"It is a very nice thing to play in Barcelona, it is one of the best tournaments in the world that we always watched on TV and to win it twice in a row is great," Gonzalez said. "And to be able to dive into the pool is something extra."

The Argentines trailed 2/5 in the Match Tie-break, but rallied to take a 5-2 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Nys and Zielinski. Molteni earned his 200th tour-level doubles victory in the semi-finals.

"Since we were kids we played on clay and this tournament was very strong and we are very happy and we enjoyed the whole week and also with the support of the audience, even when we were down," Molteni said. "It is full of Argentinians as well who come to live here, they came to see us and the Spaniards have a lot of affinity with us too and that combination makes it a very nice tournament."

Casper Ruud completed a revenge job in convincing fashion Sunday at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, where the Norwegian defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-3 to lift the trophy at the clay-court ATP 500.

Seven days after Tsitsipas prevailed in the pair’s championship-match meeting in Monte-Carlo, Ruud delivered a classy all-around display to clinch his first ATP Tour title of the season. The third seed converted three of six break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP stats, as he proved the more consistent player from the baseline on Pista Rafa Nadal.

“Honestly, this has been worth the wait,” said Ruud, who had been to seven previous finals above ATP 250 level without winning a trophy. “A lot of finals that I’ve lost have been tough, a bit disappointing, of course. Any time you reach a final, it’s nonetheless a good week, so you can’t be too hard on yourself, but this one has been a long time coming.

“I’m super happy to do it here in Barcelona in front of a packed stadium and on Rafa Nadal Court. It’s special to me because I looked up to him all my childhood, came here myself as a 13-year-old boy to watch him and the others play here. It’s a great feeling.”


With his 90-minute final triumph, Ruud snapped Tsitsipas’ 10-match winning streak. The Norwegian began the year well, reaching three finals prior to this week in Barcelona, and Sunday’s victory against Tsitsipas was his Tour-leading 29th match win of the year.

A 2022 finalist at the Nitto ATP Finals, Ruud last year missed out on qualification for the prestigious season finale. He has established himself as an early contender in this year’s PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, however. The 25-year-old has risen one spot to third as a result of his Barcelona title run.

“Just to kind of [bring] it to him a little bit more than last week,” said Ruud when asked what he had done against Tsitsipas in Barcelona compared to Monte-Carlo. “In the final in Monte-Carlo I was always on the back foot, too far behind, and he had too much time to control the game."

Ruud made the worst possible start to his fifth tour-level clash with Tsitsipas. A poor opening game handed the Greek an early break, but from there the Norwegian offered his opponent precious few free points. He reclaimed the break in the sixth game and then crucially broke through again on Tsitsipas’ serve in the 12th game to seal the opening set.


Both players largely favoured sticking to the baseline in cool conditions in Barcelona, and Ruud continued to take the upper hand in extended rallies into the second set. He broke to love in the fourth game, and that proved enough to triumph in a set in which he did not face a break point.

“It was a bit of a tricky start, got broken right away,” reflected Ruud. “So not the best start, but I managed to settle in and broke him back. Clutched up and broke him in the end of the first, which was huge.

“It’s been two long weeks for both of us. It’s obvious that at some point fatigue is going to kick in. I think we were both fit enough to play today, it’s not about that, but winning the first set was huge probably for either of us.”
