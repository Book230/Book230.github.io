Miami Open: Miami,Florida:March 17 - March 31
		<img src="Miami Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
In the midst of her final season on tour, unseeded American Danielle Collins captured the highest-level title of her career on Saturday, prevailing on home soil by toppling No.4 seed Elena Rybakina 7-5, 6-3 to win the WTA 1000 Miami Open.
In an intense 2-hour and 2-minute display of power hitting by both players, 30-year-old Collins toughed out the win to take home her third career WTA singles title, her maiden WTA 1000 title, and her first title at any level since 2021.
Collins had not defeated a Top 5 player since a win over then-No.2 Paula Badosa at San Diego in October of 2022. However, on Saturday she matched Rybakina shot for shot to claim the fifth Top 5 win of her career, and in a WTA 1000 final no less.
With the win, Collins became the first American woman to take home the Miami Open title since Sloane Stephens in 2018. She is the sixth American woman overall to claim the crown, joining Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, three-time champion Venus Williams, eight-time champion Serena Williams and Stephens.

Collins, the 2022 Australian Open runner-up and former World No.7, is currently ranked No.53 and now is the lowest-ranked woman to win the Miami Open. The previous lowest-ranked women's champion at Miami was Kim Clijsters, who was No.38 when she won the title in 2005. Collins is projected to skyrocket to No.22 in Monday's updated rankings.
Collins won her two previous titles in the span of a month in 2021, juggling continents (and surfaces) at Palermo, Italy and San Jose, U.S.A.
She made her Grand Slam final in Melbourne the following year, defeating Iga Swiatek in the semifinals before finishing runner-up to then-World No.1 Ashleigh Barty. However, until this week, Collins had not made another final since that Australian Open run.

On Saturday, Collins stared down last year's Miami finalist Rybakina, and the World No.4 had won the last three of their four career meetings -- although they all went three sets. Another factor: Rybakina had spent three more hours on court than Collins during this fortnight.
Collins lifted her power game in the final, and she bolstered it with steely mentality at pivotal moments. In the first set, Collins saved four break points in a gritty hold for 4-3, then swiped away another break point at 5-5 with a fiery backhand rally winner.
After missing out on those break point chances late in the set, the usually unflappable Rybakina wavered on serve. This year's ace leader Rybakina ceded three set points to Collins at 6-5, and the American finally achieved the first break of the set after Rybakina sent a backhand error wide.

	After an early exchange of breaks in the second set, Collins again grinded out a tough hold for 4-3, saving three break points this time. In the next game, the American's aggressive return stance paid off, forcing an error with a backhand reply to lead 5-3.
Serving for her biggest title, Collins had to stave off two break points and needed four championship points overall. But four would be enough, as the homeland hope fired a backhand crosscourt winner to hoist her first trophy in two-and-a-half years.


 When the doubles draw came out at the Miami Open, Sofia Kenin and Bethanie Mattek-Sands weren't in it. The American duo had requested a main-draw wild card, but they were on the outside looking in.
So they made their own luck. Already champions in Abu Dhabi in February, Kenin and Mattek-Sands stayed sharp in practice and came on site every day to sign in as alternates. Their effort was rewarded when Marie Bouzkova and Sara Sorribes Tormo withdrew. 
Two weeks later, Kenin and Mattek-Sands are Miami Open champions. On Sunday, the Americans came back from a set down to edge No.2 seeds Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe 4-6, 7-6(5), [11-9].



Mattek-Sands' philosophy regarding luck revolves around controlling how you respond when things don't go your way. 

Reacting positively to adversity is how Kenin and Mattek-Sands won the title. After knocking out top seeds Hsieh Su-Wei and Elise Mertens in the quarterfinals, their tournament nearly ended in a retirement just three games into their semifinal matchup against Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini. Mattek-Sands made a move for a ball and came up limping. She struggled to put weight on her left foot for much of the match. 
They found a way to win, beating the Italians in a match-tiebreak, but there were no assurances Mattek-Sands would be fit to play the final on Sunday. She spent her entire Saturday getting treatment and hoping her body would hold up for one more match.

Kenin and Mattek-Sands are one of just two teams to have won multiple titles this season. Their success has put them in the mix to grab one of the two doubles spots on the U.S. Olympic Team this summer. 

With the deep American bench, which not only includes Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, but also Nicole Melichar-Martinez, Taylor Townsend and Desirae Krawczyk. It will all be decided over the next two months on the clay.
Mattek-Sands is an Olympic veteran, having taken home a gold medal in Mixed Doubles at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
The competition has been fierce on the doubles circuit this year. No singular team has been dominating and the titles have been spread across the table. Asked to put on her commentary hat to dissect the first three months of action, Mattek-Sands highlighted the personalities currently on display. 
 
It was third time lucky for Jannik Sinner at the Miami Open presented by Itau on Sunday when the Italian defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-3, 6-1 to win his first trophy at the hard-court event and his second ATP Masters 1000 crown overall.
The Italian suffered final defeats in South Florida in 2021 and 2023 but has shown he is a different beast in 2024, entering Sunday’s final holding a 21-1 record on the year. High in confidence, Sinner ensured history did not repeat itself on Sunday, producing a clean and aggressive performance to clinch his third title of the season after one hour and 14 minutes.


Sinner, who struck 15 winners according to Infosys ATP Stats, will rise to a career-high No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings following his triumph. The 22-year-old is the first Italian to climb to No. 2 and is the first Italian to claim multiple Masters 1000 titles. He has also extended his lead for most tour-level trophies by an Italian in the Open Era to 13.
Earlier this season, Sinner won his maiden major title at the Australian Open and clinched the crown at the ATP 500 in Rotterdam. He has now won two ATP Masters 1000 titles, having lifted the trophy in Toronto last season.
The player to beat this season, Sinner produced watertight tennis throughout the fortnight in Miami. He dropped just one set en route to the title and downed Daniil Medvedev 6-1, 6-2 in the last four. Sinner has now won 25 of his past 26 matches. The key to his success has been staying in the moment.

Dimitrov also produced his best level in Miami. He attacked second serves and looked sharp at net to dispatch Top 10 stars Hubert Hurkacz, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev en route to his third Masters 1000 final.
The Bulgarian, who is up to No. 9 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run, fell in the championship match in Paris last year. His maiden triumph at this level came in 2017 when he won Cincinnati.
Earlier this season the 32-year-old broke his six-year wait for a title when he lifted the trophy in Brisbane. He entered the final against Sinner high in confidence and form but after a positive start, which led to him creating a break point in the third game, he could not live with Sinner's level. The Italian was the more consistent from the baseline and soaked up Dimitrov’s power to improve to 3-1 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series.
Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden raised their level at the perfect moment to charge to victory Saturday at the Miami Open presented by Itau.
The pair reeled off the final six points of the championship match for a 6-7(3), 6-3, 10-6 triumph against Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek inside Hard Rock Stadium. Bopanna and Ebden had three set points on serve at 6-5 in the opening set but were then forced to rally from a set down as the clash between the top two seeded teams lived up to its name in Miami.

With their victory, the Australian Open champions Bopanna and Ebden improved to 14-3 for the 2024 season. Their Miami triumph was their second at ATP Masters 1000 level after their 2023 title run in Indian Wells, and it has ensured they consolidate their position in first place in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.
Their ability to find precise serves at important moments proved crucial to them levelling their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Dodig and Krajicek at 1-1. Bopanna and Ebden won 78 per cent (39/50) of points behind their first serves and saved seven of eight break points they faced in the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
Having become the oldest Masters 1000 titlist in Indian Wells last year, the 44-year-old Bopanna also broke his own record by claiming the Miami crown.

San Luis Open: San Luis Potosi, Mexico:March 25 - March 31
		<img src="San Luis Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
At the WTA 125 San Luis Open in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, No.4 seed Podoroska stormed through the final, defeating first-time WTA 125 finalist Francesca Jones of Great Britain 6-1, 6-2 in just 67 minutes.
Podoroska, a Roland Garros semifinalist in 2020, now has two WTA 125 singles titles to her credit. She previously won the WTA 125 event in Cali, Colombia last year.
On Sunday, 78th-ranked Podoroska used flawless defense and groundstroke depth to zip through the opening set, where she won six of Jones' seven second-service points. The momentum continued as Podoroska made it all the way to 6-1, 4-1 without facing a break point.
Jones made a last-minute charge, earning her only break of the day to pull to 4-2. However, a drop shot misfire on break point in the next game gave Podoroska the double-break lead again, and the Argentine converted her third championship point in the following game.
The San Luis Potosi doubles title was won by Hungary's Anna Bondar and Slovenia's Tamara Zidansek via walkover. Laura Pigossi and Katarzyna Piter withdrew from the final due to Pigossi's right ankle injury.
This is Zidansek's first career WTA 125 doubles title, and the second for Bondar.

Megasaray Hotels Open: Antalya,Turkey:March 26 - March 31

No.5 seed Bouzas Maneiro outlasted No.4 seed Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 for the first WTA 125 title of her career.
World No.127 Bouzas Maneiro battled past a clay-court expert in her 2-hour and 28-minute victory. Former Top 25 player Begu has won two WTA 250 titles and one WTA 125 title on clay in her career.
But it was the 21-year-old rising Spaniard who clinched victory, winning exactly 75 percent of her service points in the third set, and wiping away the only break point she faced in the decider. Bouzas Maneiro now finds herself very close to a potential Top 100 debut in the near future.
A closely-contested Antalya doubles final took place on Saturday, where No.3-seeded Italians Angelica Moratelli and Camilla Rosatello squeaked past No.1 seeds Timea Babos and Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 3-6, [15-13] to hoist the trophy.
In the match-tiebreak, former WTA Doubles World No.1 Babos and Zvonareva, a former Top 10 player in both singles and doubles, held three championship points. However, the Italians survived those, then converted their third championship point to win their second WTA 125 doubles title as a pairing.
