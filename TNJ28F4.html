Hua Hin Open: Hua Hin, Thailand: Jan 29 - Feb 4, 2024
		<img src=" Hua Hin.jpg" alt=" Thailand" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Diana Shnaider captured her first title on the Hologic WTA Tour after defeating defending champion Zhu Linz 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in the final of the Thailand Open on Sunday.


Unseeded in Hua Hin, Shnaider, 19, beat the top three seeds en route to her maiden title, besting top seed Magda Linette, No.2 seed Zhu and No.3 seed Wang Xiyu. 

Shnaider is the second teenager to win a WTA title this season, joining World No.3 Coco Gauff. The 19-year-old American started her season with a successful title defense in Auckland. 

A standout at North Caroline State last year, Shnaider will surge back into the Top 100 on Monday.




Match notes: Shnaider finished her breakout 2023 season at a career-high ranking of No.60. But she came into Hua Hin ranked No.108 and searching for her first win of the season. In January, she went 0-3 across Brisbane, Hobart, and the Australian Open.

Yet despite winning just one set last month, Shnaider tore through the Hua Hin draw and won all but two of the sets she played through the week. With Sunday's victory, Shnaider improved to 2-0 against Zhu. The teenager defeated Zhu in their first meeting last fall, posting a 6-4, 6-0 win in Nanchang.

How the match was won: Playing in her second WTA final, Shnaider enjoyed a blistering start to take the opening set after 44 minutes. She overpowered Zhu from the baseline and was efficient on her break chances, converting the two break points she earned to hand the Chinese veteran her first set-loss of the week. 

Zhu turned the tables in the second set by taking advantage of a marginal dip in form from Shnaider. Zhu ran off four consecutive games to force the big-hitting final into a deciding set.


But after a lengthy set break, Shnaider returned to court with a renewed purpose. She quickly reset to break Zhu at love with a flurry of jaw-dropping baseline winners and consolidated the break to lead 2-0. Shnaider did not relent. Battering backhands from the baseline, she broke Zhu for a second break to lead 4-1 and then, using her court coverage and touch, closed out the milestone victory with a stunning backhand winner.

 Shnaider was perfect on break point conversions, breaking on all five of her opportunities. She also dominated Zhu's second serve, limiting the Chinese veteran to a 37.1% win rate. In contrast, Shnaider won 63.6% of her second-serve points.


 Top seeds Miyu Kato and Aldila Sutjiadi won their third team title, defeating No.2 seeds Guo Hanyu and Jiang Xinyu 6-4, 1-6, [10-7].

		Upper Austria Ladies Linz: Linz, Austria: Jan 29 - Feb 4, 2024
		<img src=" Linz.jpg" alt=" Melbourne" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

No.1 seed Jelena Ostapenko became the first player to win two Hologic WTA Tour singles titles this year, storming past No.2 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-2, 6-3 on Sunday to capture the Upper Austria Ladies Linz championship.


In a clash between two former Linz runners-up, 2019 finalist Ostapenko needed just 70 minutes to subdue 2018 finalist Alexandrova and collect her eighth career WTA singles title.

Records improving: With the victory, Latvia's Ostapenko leveled her robust head-to-head with Alexandrova at five wins apiece. Ostapenko is 2-0 against Alexandrova this year, having previously picked up a win over her opponent in last month's Adelaide semifinals.

Both of those 2024 wins over Alexandrova came en route to Ostapenko's two WTA 500 titles this season, as the Latvian went on to defeat Daria Kasatkina in the Adelaide final. Ostapenko currently holds a sparkling 13-2 win-loss record this year.

This has already become the first year in which Ostapenko has won multiple titles since her breakthrough 2017 season, when she claimed the first two titles of her career at Roland Garros and Seoul.


The champion speaks: "It was a really good week, and I felt like every match I was playing better and better," World No.12 Ostapenko said, after her win.


 This week was Ostapenko's first appearance at Linz since her 2019 run to the final. That year, she fell in the championship match to a teenage lucky loser who won her first WTA title: Coco Gauff.

Ostapenko's 2024 return as the top seed nearly came to an early end. Following her first-round bye this week, Ostapenko had to save a match point in the second round before squeaking past qualifier Clara Tauson. After surviving that peril, Ostapenko lost no more than three games in any of her remaining sets.


 Ostapenko was more successful, with her 28 winners nearly doubling Alexandrova's 15. And despite that overwhelming aggression, Ostapenko had only one more unforced error than Alexandrova.

Ostapenko saved the lone break point she faced all day, which came at 1-1 in the second set. The victor did need three championship points, one on Alexandrova's serve and two more on her own, before closing out the win.


 Later on Sunday, unseeded Italians Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini surprised No.1 seeds Nicole Melichar-Martinez and Ellen Perez 7-5, 4-6, [10-7] to win the Linz doubles title.

Errani and Paolini took 1 hour and 33 minutes to eke past the top seeds and claim their second WTA doubles title as a partnership. They also teamed up to win WTA 250 Monastir last year.

Errani, a former WTA Doubles World No.1, has won 29 WTA doubles titles in her career, including five Grand Slam championships. Paolini, the current top-ranked Italian in singles, has now accrued three WTA doubles titles.

			OPEN SUD DE FRANCE – MONTPELLIER :Montpellier, France: Jan 29 - Feb 4, 2024
		<img src=" Montpellier.jpg" alt=" Melbourne" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Alexander Bublik completed a week of comeback victories to clinch a hard-earned title Sunday at the Open Sud de France – Montpellier.

The second-seeded from Kazhstan rallied past Borna Coric 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 to recapture the trophy he previously won in 2022 at the indoor hard-court ATP 250. With his two-hour, 18-minute victory, Bublik became the first player in history to win an ATP Tour event having lost the first set in each of his matches.




Bublik had made a fast start to his second Lexus ATP Head2Hea meeting with the fourth-seeded Coric. He opened up an early 4-1 lead before his initially frustrated opponent raised his level to win six of the next seven games and move ahead.

As he had all week in Montpellier, however, Bublik rose to the challenge of falling behind. He maintained excellent rhythm behind his serve and threw in plenty of drop shots to keep Coric moving around the court. Despite facing four break points in the deciding set, Bublik held firm to maintain his unbeaten record against the Croatian.

The 26-year-old Bublik finished the match having won 80 per cent (44/55) of points behind his first serve, while his tally of 19 aces was also crucial to relieving the pressure in his service games.

Bublik has now won four ATP Tour titles, and his latest title run will also ensure he will rise four spots to a new career-high of No. 23 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings on Monday.

"Obviously I'm very sad about the final," reflected Coric, who is now 3-6 in tour-level finals. "It was a really good match. I enjoyed it and it was a great fight. I had my chances but he was serving really big in all the big moments and he was the better player today."
