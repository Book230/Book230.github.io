Acapulco Open: Acapulco,Mexico:Feb 25 - March 2,2024

Alex de Minaur secured a first trophy to show for his excellent start to the 2024 season on Saturday night in Acapulco, where the Australian downed Casper Ruud to successfully defend his title at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC.

The third-seeded De Minaur prevailed 6-4, 6-4 in the championship match at the ATP 500 to clinch his eighth ATP Tour crown. He converted three of four break points he earned in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Ruud since he defeated the Norwegian at the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals, and ultimately wrapped a one-hour, 57-minute victory for a second straight triumph on the Mexican Pacific Coast.

“It’s been an amazing week,” said De Minaur, who is now 15-4 for the season, in his post-match interview. “Probably a week I didn’t really expect if I’m honest. I came into Mexico not feeling my best and just kept on telling myself to keep giving myself chances. I think today I played my best match of the tournament, so I’m extremely happy with that.”


De Minaur outhit Ruud by 27 winners to eight, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Despite making just 53 per cent of first serves, the Australian was crucially able to win 74 per cent (20/27) of points behind his second delivery. He is the first player to successfully defend the title in Acapulco since the tournament switched to hard courts in 2014, and is now 11-2 at the event since making his debut in 2019.

“Acapulco has been a very good place to me for my tennis career,” said De Minaur. “The first time I won a 500, and [now] the first time I’ve defended a title in my career. I feel at home here and it’s a great place to be.”

One of the highlights of De Minaur’s triumph was a stunning all-court point in the penultimate game of the match. He showcased the lightning movement and defensive defiance that has already earned him four Top 10 wins in 2024 to outlast Ruud in a point he barely had the right to win.


With his title run, De Minaur ensured he will on Monday remain in the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings. Despite defeating Ruud in Saturday’s final, the Australian will drop one spot below the Norwegian to No. 10. He is up three spots in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, however — De Minaur now sits third behind Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev.

“Fantastic playing all week, too good tonight, too good every night,” said Ruud to De Minaur at the trophy ceremony. “It seems like you are playing in Acapulco quite well and I guess you will come back next year. I hope not, but I’m sure you will!”</p>

Acapulco, March 2, 2024.- The Monegasque Hugo Nys and the Polish Jan Zielinski were proclaimed champions of the doubles tournament of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC, which took place in the hard courts of the tennis complex of the GNP Arena.

Nys and Zielinski did not give any chance to the duo formed by the Mexican Santiago Gonzalez and the British Neil Skupsky, despite the locality enjoyed by the player from Veracruz and his partner during the whole tournament, to subdue them by 6-3, 6-2 in just one hour and nine minutes of match.

As reflected in the scoreboard, the now champions clearly did things better against opponents who, except for a moment in the first set, failed to settle in the center court and ended up being clearly outclassed.

Santi, finalists for the second time in Acapulco, had arrived with many illusions to Saturday’s final, without dropping a single set throughout the tournament, however, they were powerless against Nys and Zielinski, who were a gale from start to finish.

Nys and Zielinski started with a very good rhythm, to take a 3-0 lead in the first set with a break to Gonzalez. However, the rivals reacted with the support of the crowd to equalize at three games apiece, in what was their only important moment of the match.

Again, Nys and Zielinski took control of the actions and stepped on the accelerator to win the set 6-3, being clear dominators of the match. 

In the second set, there was not the reaction that the fans expected from their favorite players. If in the first set, the game was one-sided, in the second the dominance was more overwhelming to quickly define the match with a 6-2 score, without showing a crack through which their opponents could sneak through.

“I am very happy to be in the final after nine years. I want to congratulate Jan [Zielinski] and Hugo [Nys] for their title, they played very well, they were better than us. I wish them the best of luck for the next tournaments. I thank Neal [Skuoski], I hope next year will be the good one. We will be back next year in Acapulco,” said Gonzalez at the conclusion of the game.

For Skupski it was certainly not the night he was expecting, but in general terms he acknowledged that it was a great experience for him this week in Acapulco, hoping to consolidate his on-court partnership with the Mexican in upcoming tournaments.

On the winning side, Hugo Nys was very happy for the title. “I feel very proud, we had a solid game all week,” he said. 

Meanwhile, Zielinski highlighted the importance of this fourth title together and was optimistic to face the calendar throughout the season and, especially, the next few weeks, which includes Masters in Indian Wells and Miami.

			The French No. 5 seed dispatches seventh-seeded Kazakh, 6-4, 6-3, to win sixth career title
Tallon Griekspoor and Jan-Lennard Struff claim men’s doubles title with 6-4, 4-6, [10-6] victory over Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek
Dubai, UAE—March 2, 2024: Ugo Humbert produced a ruthless masterclass to defeat Kazakhstan’s Alexander Bublik in straight sets and seal ATP 500 victory in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships tonight.

The French No5 seed, who rises to a career-high world No. 14 after his heroics in Dubai, made it a clean sweep of six titles in six ATP finals with a clinical 6-4, 6-3 dismantling of No. 7 seed Bublik, the World No19, in front of a capacity Centre Court crowd at Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium.



Humbert, who defeated compatriot Gael Monfils, Britain’s Andy Murray, world No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and world No. 4 Daniil Medvedev to reach the final, unleashed his full repertoire of booming forehands and laser-like double-handed backhands to eclipse Bublik, who progressed past 2022 Dubai champion Andrey Rublev in a dramatic semifinal, which saw the No. 2 seed defaulted for unsportsmanlike conduct.

After tight opening exchanges where the pair were evenly matched, the final stayed on-serve until the tenth game when Humbert, who had failed to convert break points in Bublik’s two previous service games, finally broke the Kazakh’s resistance to clinch the first set 6-4.


Alexander Bublik
With Bublik delighting the Dubai crowd with a combination of whipped forehands and a deft array of dropshots, Humbert, relaxed and controlled, raced into a 3-1 second set lead after breaking Bublik. From there, the 25-year-old left-hander relied on his own dominant serve—unbroken throughout the final—to close out the match on his second championship point.

“I played a fantastic level all through the week, but it was not easy,” said Humbert, who claims the winner’s prize of US$550,140. “I really don’t know how I stayed calm. I have too much respect for [Bublik], he’s such a nice guy on and off the court, and congratulations to him on a great start to the year.”

A beaten but upbeat Bublik reflected: “This week has had almost everything for me, and I can’t wait to come back here again in 2025. Before the final, I thought if I won I would dedicate it to my son, but sorry, maybe next time,” said the 26-year-old, who pockets the runner-up prize of US$296,000.

In the men’s doubles final, the Netherlands’ Tallon Griekspoor and Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff narrowly defeated Croatia’s Ivan Dodig and the USA’s Austin Krajicek, 6-4, 4-6, [10-6]. With a pair of service breaks enough to settle the opening two sets, Griekspoor and Struff came from 1-3 down in the deciding super tiebreak, winning nine of the last 12 points to claim a maiden Dubai title and shared prize pool of US$180,700. Beaten finalists Dodig and Krajicek share a runners-up purse of US$96,370.

“It’s the first time we’ve played together, so maybe we should keep it one week,” Griekspoor joked during the post-match ceremony. “We played really well and had a great time, it was a lot of fun on court. I had such a pleasure on court this week.”



The official prize ceremony was conducted by His Highness Sheikh Hasher Bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, President of the UAE Tennis Federation; Colm McLoughlin, Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Dubai Duty Free; Ramesh Cidambi, COO of Dubai Duty Free and Chairman of the Tournament Organising Committee; Salah Tahlak, Joint COO of Dubai Duty Free, and Tournament Director of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships; Nasser Yousef Al-Marqouzi, Secretary General of the UAE Tennis Federation; and Sinead El Sibai, Senior Vice President Marketing of Dubai Duty Free.

“This magical evening has provided a fitting end to a memorable Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships fortnight. We have seen crowds of over 45,000-plus revel in match after match of wonderful tennis during the men’s ATP 500 week. Our congratulations go to the 2024 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships winners, men’s singles champion, Ugo Humbert, and our doubles champions, Tallon Griekspoor and Jan-Lennard Struff—all truly worthy winners,” said Colm McLoughlin, Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Dubai Duty Free.

“This year’s ATP 500 at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships has, once again, exceeded our expectations with a week of scintillating tennis, unbelievable moments on and off court, and enthusiastic grandstands. Thank you to all the players, officials, and fans who have contributed to the runaway success of the 32nd Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. We look forward to welcoming you back to Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium in 12 months’ time,” said Ramesh Cidambi, COO of Dubai Duty Free and Chairman of the Tournament Organising Committee.

Salah Talak, Joint COO of Dubai Duty Free, and Tournament Director of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, added: “As it does every year, the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships continue to deliver world-class ATP action. I would like to thank all our ATP players for their unwavering commitment and passion, as well as officials and tournament sponsors for their continued support.”
