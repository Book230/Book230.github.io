Former World No.1 Karolina Pliskova ended a four-year title drought by winning the Transylvania Open championship in Cluj-Napoca, Romania on Sunday. 


The Czech Pliskova defeated Romanian hope and No.8 seed Ana Bogdan 6-4, 6-3 in 1 hour and 25 minutes to capture her 17th career WTA singles title -- and her first since January of 2020, when she won the Brisbane International title for the third time.

Back in the winner's circle: Coming into this week's WTA 250 event, two-time Grand Slam finalist Pliskova had not reached a WTA singles final since August of 2021, when she finished as Montreal runner-up to Camila Giorgi.

Pliskova, who spent eight weeks ranked World No.1 in 2017, was still inside the Top 20 at this time last year. But her current ranking is No.78, and she was an unseeded player in her Cluj-Napoca tournament debut. 

However, it proved to be a fruitful week in Romania for Pliskova, who eased into the final without the loss of a set. She brought a 3-0 head-to-head record against Bogdan into Sunday's clash, and Pliskova was ultimately able to maintain her undefeated record against the home hope.

Tale of the match: Bogdan, who was seeking her first career WTA singles title, and on home soil to boot, got off to the perfect start as she built an early 3-0 lead. However, Pliskova began to find her top form as she pulled back on serve at 3-2 with a forehand winner down the line.

Pliskova saved two break points in the next game to remain on serve, then prevailed in a grueling ninth game, converting her fifth break point of that battle to serve for the set at 5-4. Pliskova fired two aces to reach triple set point and closed out the love hold with a forehand winner.

Pliskova kept control in the second set, where she broke Bogdan twice and never faced a break point. The former World No.1 slammed one final forehand winner to convert her second match point and hoist another championship trophy in her prolific career.

Pliskova won 29 of 37 first-service points in the match (78 percent), and she erased three of the four break points she stared down, all in the opening set.


Doubles victory: Earlier on Sunday, the all-American duo of Caty McNally and Asia Muhammad won the Transylvania Open doubles title. McNally and Muhammad defeated Harriet Dart of Great Britain and Slovakia's Tereza Mihalikova 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour and 18 minutes.

This week was the first time McNally and Muhammad had ever partnered up on tour, and it resulted in McNally's eighth career WTA doubles title, and the ninth career WTA doubles title for Muhammad.

World No.5 Elena Rybakina captured her second title of the season after easing past No.14 Daria Kasatkina 6-1, 6-4 in the final of the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open on Sunday. Abu Dhabi is Rybakina's seventh career title on the Hologic WTA Tour and fourth on a hard court. 

Seeded No.1 at a tournament for the second time in her career, Rybakina enjoyed a winning week in Abu Dhabi, which included wins over Danielle Collins, Cristina Bucsa and No.8 seed Liudmila Samsonova. 

"I was coming to this week without expectations because I had some issues in Melbourne, so we needed some time to get back on court," Rybakina said. "I was just trying to get as many matches as I can. Really proud about this week. With every match I felt more confident."

Rybakina moved to 11-2 on the season, having won her first title of the year in Brisbane last month. She is tied with Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka for the second-most wins on tour behind Jelena Ostapenko's tour-leading 13 wins.

Despite Sunday's loss, Kasatkina has engineered a strong start to the season. Abu Dhabi was her second final of the nascent season. She made her first in Adelaide in January. With a 9-4 record, Kasatkina ranks No.6 on the tour in match wins this year.

Both players will immediately head to Doha for the first WTA 1000 tournament of the season at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open. While Rybakina has a bye into the second round, Kasatkina is scheduled to play her first-round match against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Monday evening.

Rybakina raced through the opening set quickly, aided in part by Kasatkina's 16 unforced errors. Kasatkina, 26, was coming off a three-hour effort to get past Beatriz Haddad Maia in the semifinals. But with Rybakina landing 86 percent of her first serves, Kasatkina could find no inroads in the 25-minute set.

In the second set, Kasatkina smartly threw caution to the win and amped her baseline aggression. After striking just two winners in the first set, Kasatkina grew more opportunistic in the second set and reeled in Rybakina to level at 4-4.

But Rybakina snuffed out Kasatkina's surge with a blistering return game to break for a fifth and final time to 5-4. After a brief rain interruption as Rybakina served at 5-4, 30-all, the 2022 Wimbledon champion resumed play and coolly served out the win.

Rybakina finished the match with 17 winners to 12 unforced errors. Kasatkina hit 14 winners to 27 unforced errors, including nine double faults. 

The victory improved Rybakina's record against Kasatkina to 3-2. She has won their last two matches.

"Really happy with this week and the way I played throughout the week," Rybakina said. "It was great tennis I think I showed. In the final, I was really focused from the beginning to the end. I'm very proud."


Earlier in the day, Sofia Kenin and Bethanie Mattek-Sands took home the doubles title, defeating Linda Noskova and Heather Watson 6-4, 7-6(4) in the final. The title is Mattek-Sands' 29th career doubles title and first since 2023 Seoul. It is just the third doubles title for Kenin and the first since she won 2019 Beijing with Mattek-Sands.

Ugo Humbert delivered a five-star display for his fifth ATP Tour title Sunday at the Open 13 Provence.

Taking on the in-form Grigor Dimitrov in the championship match in Marseille, Humbert powered to a 6-4, 6-3 victory with a near-flawless performance of precise serving and rock-solid baseline play to become the seventh Frenchman to lift the title at the indoor ATP 250.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very strong mentally in finals,‚Äù said Humbert in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúIt was a great match against Grigor, he‚Äôs one of the best players at the moment, so it was not easy. It‚Äôs so nice to win at home again.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here where everything began, because I reached my first semi-final on Tour [here]. It‚Äôs really nice to win Marseille, it‚Äôs a good feeling.‚Äù


A first set dominated by serve saw no break point until the 10th game. Humbert let slip his first opportunity to take the set at 5-4, 40/A on Dimitrov‚Äôs serve but made no mistake with the second as his relentlessness from the back of the court helped him move ahead.

After then saving two break points to hold in the opening game of the second set, Humbert raced to a 3-0 lead and barely looked back as he wrapped a deserved victory in which he won 87 per cent (33/38) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

With his 84-minute victory, Humbert also became the eighth player in the Open Era to win his first five tour-level finals. The 25-year-old, who had lost to Dimitrov in both of the pair‚Äôs previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, will also on Monday rise to a new career-high of No. 18 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings as a result of his latest title run.

‚ÄúEverything is there. I am pretty solid from the baseline, I serve very well and I am strong mentally,‚Äù said Humbert, who has now won his past eight matches indoors after also lifting a trophy on home soil in Metz last November. ‚ÄúEverything is here and I put everything on court.‚Äù

Tomas Machac and Zhang Zhizhen‚Äôs fledgling partnership bagged an early title Sunday, when the pair completed an impressive title run at the Open 13 Provence in Marseille.

Having reached the Australian Open semi-finals on team debut last month, Machac and Zhang eased past Patrik Niklas-Salminen and Emil Ruusuvuori 6-3, 6-4 to lift the trophy at the indoor ATP 250 in France. Machac and Zhang saved all six break points they faced in their 67-minute championship-match triumph to improve to 8-1 as a team.


With the win, Machac became the first Czech player to win an ATP Tour doubles title since Jevaby in Cordoba in 2019, while Zhang continues to break new ground for his country. The 27-year-old Zhang, who is the first Chinese player to have broken the Top 50 of the Pepperstone ATP Rankings in singles, is the first ATP Tour doubles champion from his nation.
