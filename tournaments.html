Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters: Monte-Carlo, Monaco: April 7th - April 14th,2024

The unseeded American won her 13th straight match and her second straight title with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over No.4 seed Daria Kasatkina in the Credit One Charleston Open final on Sunday.
World No.22 Collins needed just 1 hour and 17 minutes to dismiss 11th-ranked Kasatkina and back up her hard-court Miami Open title from last week with another crown on a different surface, green clay.
The last player to win Miami and Charleston in the same year was her fellow American Serena Williams in 2013 (Williams also pulled off the feat in 2008).
 With 13 straight match-wins, Collins' current run stands alone as the longest tour-level winning streak of her career. Her new personal record bests her 12-match win streak from 2021, which also spanned surfaces and included two straight titles (though not in back-to-back weeks).
In that 2021 run, Collins won in Palermo, Italy on clay, picked up the San Jose hard-court title a few weeks later in California (beating Kasatkina in the final, no less) and reached the Montreal Round of 16 before finally being stopped by Jessica Pegula.
Stat corner: Collins is now the fourth unseeded player to win the Charleston title, joining Iva Majoli in 2002, Justine Henin in 2005, and Kasatkina herself, who won her maiden WTA singles title in Charleston in 2017.
After her exploits in Miami and Charleston, former World No.7 Collins will likely be seeded at most, if not all of her events for the rest of her career, before her announced retirement later this season. Collins, who started February ranked World No.71, is projected to re-enter the Top 15 on Monday.
Krueger wouldn't be down and out for long. On Sunday, she teamed with fellow American Sloane Stephens to defeat Ukraine sisters Lyudmyla and Nadiia Kichenok 1-6, 6-3, 10-7 in the doubles final.
