	Adelaide International :Adelaide , Australia   : Jan 8 - Jan 13, 2024
		<img src=" Adelaide.jpg" alt=" Adelaide" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
Jiri Lehecka prevailed in a clash between two big-hitting 22-year-olds Saturday at the Adelaide International, where the Czech overcame Jack Draper to claim his maiden ATP Tour crown.

Lehecka dug deep for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 comeback victory at the hard-court ATP 250 in South Australia. Lehecka dialled in to clinch a tight second set before taking control early in the decider of his first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Draper en route to a two-hour, eight-minute championship-match win.



Lehecka outhit Draper by 34 winners to 24. The seventh-seeded Czech used his heavy forehand to increasingly dictate rallies as the match wore on, and he also showcased his mental resilience when he crucially held serve from 3-1, 0/40 in the third set.



The first Czech ATP Tour title winner since Jiri Vesely in Pune in 2020, Lehecka will on Monday rise nine spots to a new career high of No. 23 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings as a result of his title run. His Adelaide triumph will boost his confidence as he heads to the Australian Open, where he reached his maiden major quarter-final in 2023. The Czech will take on Bernabe Zapata Miralles in his opening match in Melbourne, where Draper starts his campaign against Marcos Giron.



Jelena Ostapenko captured her seventh career title, defeating No.15 Daria Kasatkina 6-3, 6-2 in Saturday's Adelaide International final. The win is Ostapenko's fourth hard-court championship title and first since winning 2022 Dubai. 


On Monday, for the first time in over five years, Ostapenko will return to the Top 10. The 2017 Roland Garros champion was last ranked inside the Top 10 in September of 2018. 



Ostapenko has enjoyed a solid start to the 2024 season. She opened her year by making the Brisbane quarterfinals and taking home the doubles title with Lyudmyla Kichenok. Seeded No.6 in Adelaide, Ostapenko came through a tough draw to defeat Sorana Cirstea, Caroline Garcia, Marta Kostyuk, Ekaterina Alexandrova and Kasatkina.


Going into the final, Ostapenko held a 5-2 advantage in the head-to-head series, but Kasatkina won their only previous hard-court meeting. That came more than six years ago in the third round of the US Open in 2017. 

The quicker courts of Adelaide have suited Kasatkina over the past two years, having been a finalist last year. This year she benefitted from back-to-back walkovers in the quarterfinals and semifinals after Laura Siegemund and No.2 seed Jessica Pegula withdrew ahead of their respective matches.

Ostapenko was tested early in the tournament, needing back-to-back three-set wins to beat Cirstea and Garcia. But since then, Ostapenko's aim has been precise and destructive. In an extreme contrast of styles, Ostapenko's baseline power overwhelmed Kasatkina's court craft and guile. 




Ostapenko fired 32 winners to 27 unforced errors in the win. Kasatkina hit 12 winners to 13 unforced errors. 

 In doubles, Taylor Townsend and Beatriz Haddad Maia defeated Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic 7-5, 6-3 to win the title.

Townsend has now won three Adelaide doubles titles in the last two years, all with different partners. Last year, Townsend won Adelaide 1 with Asia Muhammed and Adelaide 2 with Luisa Stefani.

	Hobart International : Hobart , Australia : Jan 8 - Jan 13 , 2024 
		<img src=" Hobart.jpg" alt=" Hobart" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
Rising American Emma Navarro captured the first Hologic WTA Tour title of her career on Saturday, overcoming two-time champion Elise Mertens 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 to win the Hobart International.


In the first Hobart final between the top two seeds since 1998, it was No.2-seeded Navarro who outlasted No.1 seed Mertens in their first career meeting. Navarro needed a grueling 2 hours and 48 minutes to prevail in the first WTA singles final of her burgeoning career.



Emma was ranked No.149 at this time last year but has since skyrocketed to her current career-high ranking of No.31.

The 22-year-old Navarro reached the Auckland semifinals last week before notching her maiden final and title this week in the Tasmanian capital. She is 8-1 this season heading into 2024's first Grand Slam, the Australian Open.

With Saturday's win, Navarro becomes the second straight American to prevail in Hobart, after Lauren Davis won the title last year.

Former World No.12 Mertens, who won back-to-back Hobart titles in 2017 and 2018, suffered a rare loss at this event on Saturday. The Belgian still holds an excellent 15-3 career win-loss record at the tournament.


Key moments: Navarro swept through the first set and was up a break on three separate occasions in the second set. However, Mertens broke back immediately each time, then saved six break points in a gritty hold for 5-4. Mertens took the momentum from that game to break Navarro and level the match at one set apiece.

Navarro also broke Mertens two times in the early stages of the third set, but again, the Belgian stayed within touching distance through 5-5. However, Navarro edged ahead for good by cracking a rally forehand to break for 6-5, and she converted her second match point in the next game with a forehand winner down the line.

Navarro had 39 winners to Mertens' 24 in the final. The American held 19 break points in the showdown and converted eight of those chances.

Looking ahead to Melbourne: Navarro will make her Australian Open main-draw debut next week, and as a seeded player at No.27 to boot. She will face China's Wang Xiyu in the opening round in Melbourne.

As for Mertens, she is seeded No.25 at the upcoming major, where she will meet Egypt's Mayar Sherif in the first round. The 28-year-old Mertens was an Australian Open semifinalist in her 2018 main-draw debut, which came directly after she won her second straight Hobart title.


 The Hobart International doubles final was plkayed later on Saturday, where No.2 seeds Chan Hao-Ching and Giuliana Olmos defeated unseeded Guo Hanyu and Jiang Xinyu 6-3, 6-3 for the title.

In the second set, Guo and Jiang battled back from 5-0 down to 5-3, but Olmos pulled together a love hold in the next game to close out the victory after 1 hour and 16 minutes.

It is the 20th career WTA doubles title for Chan, and the sixth WTA doubles title for Olmos. It is their first title as a partnership, having played their first event together just last summer in Washington, D.C.

Asb Classic: Auckland,New Zealand: Jan 8 - Jan 13 , 2024 
		<img src=" Asb Classic.jpg" alt=" Auckland" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
 
Chilean qualifier Alejandro Tabilo claimed his first tour-level title on Saturday at the ASB Classic with a gritty win against Taro Daniel at the Auckland ATP 250. In a 6-2, 7-5 victory, Tabilo stormed through the opening set before holding off his Japanese opponent's charge in a tense second.


Behind his title run, the 26-year-old lefty has soared 33 places this week in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings to No. 49, setting himself up for a Top 50 debut. The first men's singles player to capture his maiden ATP Tour title in 2024, Tabilo will soon be joined by Jiri Lehecka or Jack Draper, who will compete for their first title in the Adelaide final.

The Chilean lost just one set in six Auckland victories, including two qualifying wins. He upset sixth seed and Next Gen ATP Finals runner-up Arthur Fils in the semi-finals to advance to his second ATP Tour final (Cordoba 2022) and made the most of his opportunity in New Zealand.

 


Tabilo's final victory made him the first Chilean to win a hard-court tour-level title since Fernando Gonzalez in 2007 (Beijing) and the third active Chilean singles champion on the ATP Tour alongside Cristian Garin and Nicolas Jarry. He is also the first qualifier to win a tour-level crown since Juan Manuel Cerundolo in 2021 (Cordoba). 

In his first Lexus ATP Head2Head matchup against Daniel, Tabilo powered to the opening set behind four straight games from 2-2, leaning on his big forehand to dictate the baseline rallies. The match tightened in set two as Daniel found his range, hitting several passing shots to create three break points across his first four return games. Tabilo escaped a five-deuce game — the longest of the match — to hold for 4-3 and later battled through two deuces to make it 6-5.

The Chilean, who won 15 of 25 net points in the match, locked in from the baseline to earn the decisive break in the match's final game. He created his first break points of the second set at 0/40, and again relied on his powerful forehand to wrap up the win in one hour, 36 minutes.
