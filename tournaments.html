Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic earned their third title of the season Friday when they were crowned champions at the BNP Paribas Open.

The Dutch-Croatian duo overcame fifth seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos 7-6(2), 7-6(4) in a one-hour, 51-minute final after winning 85 per cent of their first-serve points. A pivotal moment came on serve at 5-6 in the second set, when they fought off a set point to avoid a Match Tie-break.

"It came down to the tie-break, where anybody can win. We started both tie-breaks well with a mini break and maybe that was the reason as we were leading the whole tie-break,” Mektic said. "The score tells you what a high quality match it was.”



Despite failing to convert any of their five break points, Koolhof and Mektic stepped in on returns in both tie-breaks and looked to cut off any ball at net to lift their first ATP Masters 1000 team title. 

"It means a lot because it's one of the strongest Masters 1000 events because you have a lot of top singles players also playing," Koolhof said. "In last year's final I lost 10-8 in the [Match Tie-break], so I had some unfinished business to do here. We're very happy to have won this one." 

Koolhof and Mektic opened the season with an ATP 250 crown in Auckland, where they ousted Granollers and Zeballos in the final. Having also won in Rotterdam, the pair boasts a 16-3 season record. They are 14-0 when winning the first set.

"When I woke up this morning I was thinking that I had a 250, a 500 and hopefully now a 1000, so maybe the next one will be a major if we can capture one of the remaining three," Koolhof said. "It's been an incredible start to the season. We've played six events and won three. So if we can keep a 50 per cent ratio we'll be very happy."

The pair of former World No. 1s in the PIF ATP Rankings, who won the 2020 Nitto ATP Finals together, rejoined forces at the start of this season after they each played with different partners the past three years.

Mektic, 35, celebrated his 300th career match win when he and the 34-year-old Koolhof advanced past the quarter-finals.

Top seeds Hsieh Su-Wei and Elise Mertens won their second BNP Paribas Open doubles title after defeating No.3 seeds Storm Hunter and Katerina Siniakova 6-3, 6-4 in the final on Saturday. 


The title is Mertens' 20th career doubles title and Hsieh's 34th. This is the fourth Indian Wells title for Hsieh and her second with Mertens. The two first lifted the trophy together in 2021. Hsieh also won the title in 2014 (w/ Peng) and 2018 (w/ Strycova). Mertens has now won Indian Wells three times, having won her first with Aryna Sabalenka in 2019.

"It was a little bit special this year, because I didn't play this tournament for a while, and I was sick since Qatar, so I haven't practiced a lot," Hsieh said. "And I couldn't do any exercise because the doctor suggest to me do not do any sport."

The reigning Australian Open champions capped off a dominating fortnight in the desert, as the duo ran through the draw without losing a set. Hsieh and Mertens defeated No.6 seeds Demi Schuurs and Luisa Stefani, No.4 seeds Nicole Melichar-Martinez and Ellen Perez, and the No.3 seeds on Sunday to win their second team title of the year. 



Saturday's final was the season's second meeting between Hsieh/Mertens and Hunter/Siniakova. The two faced off in the Australian Open semifinals, where Hsieh/Mertens won 7-5, 1-6, 6-3 on their way to the title. Hunter and Siniakova captured their first team title of the year last month at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.

After exchanging breaks to start the match, both teams protected their serves until Hsieh and Mertens broke Siniakova at love for a 5-3 lead. Mertens fired a clean backhand winner up the line to seal the break and then served out the set.


The second set went with the server with no break points generated until 4-4. Hsieh fired a perfectly read backhand winner to earn break points on Hunter's serve and the eventual champions converted and closed out the 70-minute victory. 

"Very happy about our game today," Mertens said. "I think a lot of things worked. We were there from the beginning. Only lost our serve once, it was actually my serve.

"Yeah, I think we were really there. Also, especially on the second set, we didn't drop anything. She had an amazing point in the 4-4. In that game she had an amazing point which really helped."
