Rabat Open: Rabat,Morocco:May 18th- May 25th, 2024

			<p>

Peyton Stearns had to survive a couple marathon matches to make this week's Grand Prix Son Altesse Royale La Princesse Lalla Meryem final, but it was a very different story on Saturday, where she eased to her first WTA singles title.


The 22-year-old American Stearns, ranked World No.81, defeated 66th-ranked Mayar Sherif of Egypt 6-2, 6-1 in 1 hour and 12 minutes to capture her maiden trophy on tour.

Stearns battled through two narrow victories in the past two days to squeak into Saturday's championship match -- her second tour-level final after a runner-up showing at 2023 Bogota.

In the quarterfinals, 2022 NCAA champion Stearns trailed defending champion Lucia Bronzetti 5-0 in the third set, but the American reeled off the next seven games to make a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 escape, saving two match points in the process.

Then in the semifinals, Stearns had to grind through a 3-hour and 15-minute clash with Viktoriya Tomova, eventually prevailing 6-7(6), 7-5, 7-6(4). That was one of the 15 longest matches of the year on the Hologic WTA Tour.



 By contrast, Sherif had rolled into Saturday's showpiece match. Sherif, a Hologic WTA Tour titlist at 2022 Parma, had not lost more than six games in any of her four wins en route to her third career final.

But it was a reversal of fortunes on Saturday, with Stearns successfully shaking off any potential fatigue from the week. The American took control from the start, winning the opening set without facing a break point.

Sherif garnered four break points in the second set, but Stearns stayed resolute and was never broken. Serving for the match, Stearns stared down two break points at 15-40, but she came back from that deficit and closed out the win at the first time of asking.



Doubles romp: The doubles final was contested on Saturday, where No.4 seeds Irina Khromacheva and Yana Sizikova eased past No.2 seeds Anna Danilina and Xu Yifan 6-3, 6-2 in 1 hour and 19 minutes. Khromacheva and Sizikova won 11 of 12 second-service return points, leading to six breaks.

Sizikova has taken the title in Rabat for the second straight year, having triumphed last year alongside Sabrina Santamaria. This is Sizikova's fifth career WTA doubles title overall.

Khromacheva, who has won her fourth career WTA doubles title,is on an 11-match winning streak at all levels. In her two previous events, she won titles at WTA 250 Rouen (with Timea Babos) and WTA 125 Parma (with one of the players she defeated on Saturday, Danilina).

				Gonet Geneva Open: Geneva,Switzerland:May 19th- May 25th, 2024

			<p>
After a rock-solid start on the European clay in 2024, Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic turned their consistency into a trophy Saturday at the Gonet Geneva Open.

The third-seeded Salvadoran-Croatian pair defeated Lloyd Glasspool and Jean-Julien Rojer 7-6(2), 7-5 to claim the trophy at the Swiss clay-court ATP 250. Arevalo and Pavic kept cool under pressure in a one-hour, 44-minute championship match during which they saved all three break points they faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Arevalo and Pavic reached back-to-back semi-finals on clay in April in Monte-Carlo and Barcelona, respectively. They also reached the championship match in Rome earlier this month.

With victory in Geneva, the pair took its title tally to two for the 2024 season. Arevalo and Pavic, who also won an ATP 250 on team debut in Hong Kong in January, are currently fifth in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

Casper Ruud scored a hat-trick Saturday at the Gonet Geneva Open, where he captured his third title at the clay ATP 250.

The Norwegian, who won Geneva in 2021 and 2022, pulled double duty to triumph in Switzerland after Friday rain postponed his semi-final match to Saturday. Ruud, seeded second, saved a match point to down Flavio Cobolli 1-6, 6-1, 7-6(4) in the last four before returning to court and ousting Tomas Machac 7-5, 6-3 in the final.

Ruud tallied three consecutive games from 4-5 in the opening set of the final after Machac committed a double fault while holding a set point on serve at 5-4. “He definitely deserved to win the first set, but that’s tennis sometimes. It’s not always fair,” Ruud said.


The World No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings then built upon his momentum, fearlessly striking his forehand to create a 3-0 cushion in the second set.

Despite needing a deciding set in his four previous matches in Geneva, Ruud remained in control to avoid such drama in a one-hour, 47-minute final. The 25-year-old improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the Czech.


A 12-time tour-level titlist, Ruud leads the ATP Tour with 34 wins this season. He is the first three-time champion in Geneva tournament history. The 2022 Nitto ATP Finals runner-up is fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Ruud is aiming for a third trip to the prestigious year-end event.

Machac, 23, was competing in his first ATP Tour final. He is up to a career-high No. 34 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following a standout Geneva run in which he defeated World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in a three-set semi-final.

			Open Parc: Lyon,France:May 19th-May 25th, 2024


		<img src="ATP Lyon Open.jpg" alt="France" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
			At the Open Parc, Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten continued the red-hot start to their partnership by clinching their second ATP Tour title together.

Heliovaara and Patten dug deep for a 3-6, 7-6(4), 10-8 final triumph against Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti in Lyon. The Finnish-British team at one point trailed by a set and a break, and later fended off a match point to hold serve for 5-5 in the second set. From there, Heliovaara and Patten took control to secure a one-hour, 43-minute win in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Bhambri and Olivetti.

Since teaming for the first time in April, Heliovaara and Patten have won four of the seven events they have contested across the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour. As well as their ATP 250 triumphs in Marrakech and now Lyon, the pair has also lifted Challenger trophies in Madrid and Turin.

Now 8-2 as a team at tour-level, Heliovaara and Patten are up nine spots to 19th in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings as a result of their Lyon run.

Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard cut through tie-break tension to complete a dream week and lift his maiden ATP Tour title in the city of his birth Saturday at the Open Parc.

Roared on by a vocal Lyon crowd, the 20-year-old wild card battled past sixth seed Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(7) in a dramatic championship match at the ATP 250. Mpetshi Perricard was a point away from defeat at 6/7 in the deciding-set tie-break but held firm for a famous two-hour, 29-minute win in just his fourth tour-level event.



It is the second year in a row that a young French star has triumphed in Lyon, after Arthur Fils also won his maiden ATP Tour crown there last year. Overall, Mpetshi Perricard is the fourth French champion in seven editions of the clay-court ATP 250.

He was forced to hold his nerve to prevail in an absorbing maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Etcheverry, who was also chasing his first tour-level title but entered the final with the experience of two previous ATP Tour final appearances behind him. Mpetshi Perricard did not let a bad missed forehand volley at 5/4 in the tie-break get to him, however, and he closed out victory with the help of some typically fierce groundstrokes.


Mpetshi Perricard finished having converted three of six break points he earned against Etcheverry, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He is the third player from outside the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings to win an ATP Tour title this season (after No. 136 Darderi in Cordoba and No. 135 Berrettini in Marrakech). He is also the lowest-ranked titlist in Lyon tournament history.

The 20-year-old will not be outside the Top 100 much longer, however. Thanks to his Lyon run, during which he also earned the biggest win of his career by beating World No. 19 Alexander Bublik, the Frenchman will on Monday rise 51 spots to a career-high World No. 66.

		Internationaux de Strasbourg:Strasbourg,France:May 18th-May 25th, 2024

			Madison Keys' excellent 2024 run on the red clay of Europe hit new heights on Saturday, as she captured her first title of the year by cruising past her compatriot Danielle Collins 6-1, 6-2 at the WTA 500 Internationaux de Strasbourg.


In the all-American final, No.4 seed Keys powered her way to victory over No.3 seed Collins in just 72 minutes of play. It is Keys' eighth career WTA singles title, and her first on red clay (she also won the Charleston title on green clay in 2019).


 Keys has done something very few players have been able to do of late -- defeat Collins. Coming into Saturday's final, Collins had won 22 of her past 24 matches, with her only two losses in that stretch coming to World No.2 Aryna Sabalenka.

However, Keys was also in spectacular form entering the final, rebounding from a late start to the season. Keys missed the first two months of 2024 action while rehabbing her shoulder, making her season debut at Indian Wells in March.


After a loss in her opening clay-court match on the green clay of Charleston, Keys has gone 10-3 on red clay this spring, also reaching the Madrid semifinals and the Rome quarterfinals. The only player to beat Keys on red clay so far this year: World No.1 Iga Swiatek.

Keys and Collins had split their two previous meetings, but those were both on hard court, and they had not faced off since 2020. On Saturday, Keys mastered the dirt, winning 71 percent of points returning the Collins second serve, and converting six of her 16 break points.



Collins boldly saved four championship points in the final game of the match, but Keys converted her fifth chance with a forehand return winner crosscourt. With the straight-sets win, Keys completed a nearly flawless week in Strasbourg, where she did not drop a set.


Despite her loss on Saturday, former World No.7 Collins will still be rewarded for her outstanding play of late -- she is projected to re-enter the Top 10 on Monday, which will be her first appearance in that echelon since August 2022.


Doubles nail-biter: Earlier on Saturday, Cristina Bucsa of Spain and Monica Niculescu won a closely-contested doubles final, edging past Asia Muhammad of the United States and Indonesia's Aldila Sutjiadi 3-6, 6-4, [10-6] in 1 hour and 32 minutes.

After splitting the first two sets, Bucsa and Niculescu rolled to a commanding 9-1 lead in the match-tiebreak, grabbing eight match points. However, Muhammad and Sutjiadi reeled off the next five points in a row before the champions converted their sixth opportunity.

It is the 11th career WTA doubles title for 36-year-old Niculescu, but her first title on tour since 2021.

Bucsa, meanwhile, is on a doubles roll, winning her third WTA doubles title of the year and her fourth overall. Already this season, Bucsa won back-to-back titles at WTA 250 Bogota (with Kamilla Rakhimova) and on home soil at WTA 1000 Madrid (with Sara Sorribes Tormo).
