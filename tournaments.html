Mutua Madrid Open: Madrid, Spain: April 22nd - May 5th,2024

Spanish hopes Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo excited the crowds at the Caja Magica on Sunday by capturing the Mutua Madrid Open doubles title on home soil.


Playing their first tournament together as a doubles team, No.8 seeds Bucsa and Sorribes Tormo rolled past No.6 seeds Barbora Krejcikova and Laura Siegemund 6-0, 6-2 in the final to triumph at the year's first clay-court WTA 1000 event.

Bucsa and Sorribes Tormo were dominant over two Grand Slam doubles champions in the 73-minute championship match. Buoyed by home support, the Spaniards converted half of their 12 break points while only dropping serve once.

This is Bucsa's third career WTA doubles title, her second of the year (after Bogota with Kamilla Rakhimova) and her first at WTA 1000-level. Bucsa reached her career-high doubles ranking of No.38 last week and is projected to climb even higher on Monday.

Sorribes Tormo won her fifth career WTA doubles title in Madrid, and her first this year. She also set a career-high doubles ranking this month, at No.26, and projected rankings could see her make her Top 20 doubles debut on Monday.

This is Sorribes Tormo's second doubles title at WTA 1000-level. She previously won WTA 1000 Beijing last autumn alongside Marie Bouzkova.
				
"I remember exactly when he was playing Medvedev in Australia, and it clicked for him," Swiatek said. "He also struggled for a bit of time, he was tense, and I think stressed.
 
"That kind of gave me hope that maybe it will click, even after two hours."


While much of the discussion about Swiatek centers on her formidable straight-set victories, she has also demonstrated remarkable resilience in securing several challenging three-set wins.
 
Notably, her match-point saving win against Kaia Kanepi at the 2022 Australian Open and her gritty victory against Karolina Muchova in last year's Roland Garros final stand out. More recently, she staged a comeback from 4-1 down in the final set to defeat Danielle Collins at this year's Australian Open.


But Madrid was different. The 22-year-old Swiatek saved three championship points in the longest final of the year to defeat two-time champion Aryna Sabalenka 6-4, 5-7, 7-6(7).  
 
"Physically and tennis-wise, I wasn't surprised [I could maintain the high-level for three hours], but I was surprised that in the third set I felt the best mentally," Swiatek said after the 3-hour, 11-minute match. "Because, yeah, I actually felt like I needed to dig through for these two hours and it didn't really work. I was, like, 'Oh, my God, am I going to feel a little bit more loose soon?'"
 
As Swiatek said after the match, neither player deserved to lose. Sabalenka delivered what was arguably the finest performance of her career, maintaining a high level of play from start to finish. Yet, when the final point was played, it was Swiatek who had the winner’s trophy in hand.


"I think it depends on what I'm going to do with this match now," Swiatek said on the WTA Insider Podcast, "because I can let it go and rest and just forget about it, or I can really take a big lesson from it. 
 
"So it depends on what is going to happen in the next weeks in terms of how I analyze it. If I am going to take this hope that even if I am feeling stressed for two hours I can still win a match or I can still feel better, it will give me a lot for the rest of my career."


Aryna Sabalenka: A third Madrid Open title in four years was not in the cards for Sabalenka, but the World No.2 still exits Madrid with renewed momentum after a relative lull in her results since defending her Australian Open title.

"I'm super happy that here in Madrid I was able to bring it all together and to be able to get back to my level," Sabalenka said in post-match press. "I think it's, you know, it only can get better from now on."
Sebastian Korda and Jordan Thompson’s first week competing together on the doubles court ended in Mutua Madrid Open glory on Saturday afternoon in Spain.

The scratch team of singles stars defeated Ariel Behar and Adam Pavlasek 6-3, 7-6(7) to clinch the trophy at the ATP Masters 1000 event. After entering the draw using a spot reserved for singles players as part of a new doubles format being trialled in Madrid, Korda and Thompson dropped just one set across five matches en route to the title.

“We practised a tonne, and this was our first tournament together,” said Korda after winning his maiden tour-level doubles title. “It was a pretty good one, and [we will play] next week again in Rome. It was a lot of fun playing with Jordan this week and looking forward to next week.”


Thompson stepped on court sporting a cut above his left eye. After clinching a 77-minute victory alongside Korda, the Australian explained that the pair’s morning practice was to blame.

“He hit too good of a return and I just smoked myself in the head,” explained Thompson, who is now a six-time ATP Tour doubles champion. “I thought I was heading for the ER. It wasn’t that bad. A bit of a headache, but not bad. [The trophy] will help smooth things out.”


In singles, Korda and Thompson are No. 26 and No. 33, respectively, in the PIF ATP Rankings. It is the second consecutive year that the Madrid doubles trophy has been lifted by players more renowned for their singles prowess, after Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev won the title in 2023.


Korda and Thompson were ice cool under pressure beneath the Madrid sun to seal their win. They saved all six break points they faced against Behar and Pavlasek, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and Korda later revealed they had developed a fixed plan on serve at the start of their partnership.

“Our slogan at the beginning of the week was Shake & Bake,” said the American. “That’s kind of been our motto this whole week. It’s been working.”

Korda and Thompson clinched a decisive break in the fourth game on the way to winning the first set inside Manolo Santana Stadium. Also chasing their first ATP Tour crown as a team, Behar and Pavlasek raised their level in the second set but were crucially unable to convert their only set point at 7/6 in the tie-break.
