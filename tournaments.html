Jasmine Paolini pulled off a gritty come-from-behind victory on Saturday to capture the highest-level title of her career, defeating qualifier Anna Kalinskaya 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 in the WTA 1000 Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships final.


Paolini, the World No.26 from Italy, outlasted 40th-ranked Kalinskaya in 2 hours and 13 minutes, battling back from a break down in each of the second and third sets. With the win, Paolini claims her second career singles title on the Hologic WTA Tour, and her first at WTA 1000-level.

Back in the winner's circle: Paolini took home her first career WTA singles title at WTA 250 Portoroz in 2021, defeating Kalinskaya on the way to that trophy. Since that triumph, though, Paolini had been in three finals and lost them all.

Additionally, Paolini had fallen to Kalinskaya earlier this year in a high-stakes match at the Australian Open. In the first Grand Slam Round of 16 for both of them, Kalinskaya prevailed in straight sets to make a breakthrough quarterfinal.


However, Paolini turned those statistics around on Saturday, becoming the second Italian to take home the Dubai title after Sara Errani prevailed in 2016 (Dubai was a WTA 500 event that season).

Paolini is the third Italian to win a WTA 1000 title, following in the footsteps of Flavia Pennetta at 2014 Indian Wells and Camila Giorgi at 2021 Montreal.

The victory continues Paolini's recent rise up the rankings. The 28-year-old was ranked No.64 this time last year, but finished inside the year-end Top 30 for the first time in 2023. After her Dubai run, Paolini is projected to make her Top 15 debut on Monday.
				
DUBAI -- No.4 seeds Storm Hunter and Katerina Siniakova won their first title of the 2024 season at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, defeating No.3 seeds Nicole Melichar-Martinez and Ellen Perez 6-4, 6-2 in the final on Saturday. The victory is Hunter's eighth career doubles title and Siniakova's 23rd.


Hunter and Siniakova won their first title together in a one-off pairing at 2022 Berlin, but the two former No.1s have teamed up for the 2024 season to form a formidable pair. Siniakova parted ways with long-time partner Barbora Krejcikova in the off-season and Hunter forged a similar path, splitting with Elise Mertens. 

Hunter and Siniakova needed just two tournaments together to capture their first title of the year. The Australian-Czech duo did not lose a set in Dubai, defeating Kato/Sudjiati, Aoyama/Krunic, and No.2 seeds Dabrowski/Routliffe to make Saturday's final. 


Little separated Hunter and Siniakova and Melichar-Martinez and Perez through the first set. Neither team generated a break point until the eighth game of the match. Facing down a deciding point at 3-4, Perez misfired on a double fault to give the eventual champions the only break of the set. 

With Siniakova patrolling the net and Hunter stepping in on baseline exchanges, the duo rode their momentum through the second set. Melichar-Martinez and Perez were unable to break serve in the match. Hunter and Siniakova broke in the opening game of the set and protected their lead to seal the win after 1 hour and 16 minutes. 


Siniakova and Hunter dominated the deciding points in the match, converting on three of four in the match. 

Melichar-Martinez and Perez were competing in their second final of the season, having made their first earlier in the month in Linz. The American-Australian duo was bidding to snap a seven-match losing streak in tournament finals.

Siniakova and Hunter will now head to America to compete at next week's Cymbiotika San Diego Open before turning to the back-to-back WTA 1000 tournaments at the BNP Paribas Open and Miami Open. 			</p>
