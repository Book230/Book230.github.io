Credit One Charleston Open: Charleston, South Carolina: April 1st - April 7th,2024


		<img src="Charleston p2.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
The unseeded American won her 13th straight match and her second straight title with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over No.4 seed Daria Kasatkina in the Credit One Charleston Open final on Sunday.
World No.22 Collins needed just 1 hour and 17 minutes to dismiss 11th-ranked Kasatkina and back up her hard-court Miami Open title from last week with another crown on a different surface, green clay.
The last player to win Miami and Charleston in the same year was her fellow American Serena Williams in 2013 (Williams also pulled off the feat in 2008).
 With 13 straight match-wins, Collins' current run stands alone as the longest tour-level winning streak of her career. Her new personal record bests her 12-match win streak from 2021, which also spanned surfaces and included two straight titles (though not in back-to-back weeks).
In that 2021 run, Collins won in Palermo, Italy on clay, picked up the San Jose hard-court title a few weeks later in California (beating Kasatkina in the final, no less) and reached the Montreal Round of 16 before finally being stopped by Jessica Pegula.
Stat corner: Collins is now the fourth unseeded player to win the Charleston title, joining Iva Majoli in 2002, Justine Henin in 2005, and Kasatkina herself, who won her maiden WTA singles title in Charleston in 2017.
After her exploits in Miami and Charleston, former World No.7 Collins will likely be seeded at most, if not all of her events for the rest of her career, before her announced retirement later this season. Collins, who started February ranked World No.71, is projected to re-enter the Top 15 on Monday.
Krueger wouldn't be down and out for long. On Sunday, she teamed with fellow American Sloane Stephens to defeat Ukraine sisters Lyudmyla and Nadiia Kichenok 1-6, 6-3, 10-7 in the doubles final.

Open Internacional Femeni’ Solgirone’s: La Bisbal D'Empordà’,Spain: April 1st - April 7th,2024 
		<img src="San Luis Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
At the WTA 125 San Luis Open in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, No.4 seed Podoroska stormed through the final, defeating first-time WTA 125 finalist Francesca Jones of Great Britain 6-1, 6-2 in just 67 minutes.
Podoroska, a Roland Garros semifinalist in 2020, now has two WTA 125 singles titles to her credit. She previously won the WTA 125 event in Cali, Colombia last year.
On Sunday, 78th-ranked Podoroska used flawless defense and groundstroke depth to zip through the opening set, where she won six of Jones' seven second-service points. The momentum continued as Podoroska made it all the way to 6-1, 4-1 without facing a break point.
Jones made a last-minute charge, earning her only break of the day to pull to 4-2. However, a drop shot misfire on break point in the next game gave Podoroska the double-break lead again, and the Argentine converted her third championship point in the following game.
The San Luis Potosi doubles title was won by Hungary's Anna Bondar and Slovenia's Tamara Zidansek via walkover. Laura Pigossi and Katarzyna Piter withdrew from the final due to Pigossi's right ankle injury.
This is Zidansek's first career WTA 125 doubles title, and the second for Bondar.

Megasaray Hotels Open: Antalya,Turkey:March 26 - March 31
		<img src="Antalya Open.jpg" alt="California" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
No.5 seed Bouzas Maneiro outlasted No.4 seed Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 for the first WTA 125 title of her career.
World No.127 Bouzas Maneiro battled past a clay-court expert in her 2-hour and 28-minute victory. Former Top 25 player Begu has won two WTA 250 titles and one WTA 125 title on clay in her career.
But it was the 21-year-old rising Spaniard who clinched victory, winning exactly 75 percent of her service points in the third set, and wiping away the only break point she faced in the decider. Bouzas Maneiro now finds herself very close to a potential Top 100 debut in the near future.
A closely-contested Antalya doubles final took place on Saturday, where No.3-seeded Italians Angelica Moratelli and Camilla Rosatello squeaked past No.1 seeds Timea Babos and Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 3-6, [15-13] to hoist the trophy.
In the match-tiebreak, former WTA Doubles World No.1 Babos and Zvonareva, a former Top 10 player in both singles and doubles, held three championship points. However, the Italians survived those, then converted their third championship point to win their second WTA 125 doubles title as a pairing.
