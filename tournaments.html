Porsche Tennis Grand Prix: Stuggart,Germany: April 15th - April 21th,2024

STUTTGART, Germany -- World No.4 Elena Rybakina captured her third Hologic WTA Tour title of the year on Sunday after defeating No.27 Marta Kostyuk 6-2, 6-2 in the final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. 


Stuttgart is Rybakina's eighth career title and third on clay, following wins at 2023 Rome and 2019 Bucharest. The 24-year-old leaves Germany with the outright lead in titles this season, adding Stuttgart to a collection that includes Brisbane and Abu Dhabi. The victory over Kostyuk was her tour-leading 26th win of the season.

"I always believe in myself, of course, but it's not only depends on me," Rybakina said. "There is a lot of great players, tough opponents. But I know if I feel fresh, if I'm physically ready, healthy, I'm playing my game, of course I have all the chances to win a Grand Slam on any surface."


Playing in her fifth final of the season, Rybakina opened the match by breaking Kostyuk's serve and never looked back. With efficient serving, the tour's ace leader sealed the first set after just 30 minutes. She lost just one point behind her first serve (15 of 16) and did not face a break point. Rybakina won 30 points to Kostyuk's 17.

Rybakina came into Sunday's final after snapping World No.1 Iga Swiatek's 10-match win streak at Stuttgart, winning 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the semifinals. 

"I knew that I have to be focused from the beginning, and also, compare the match with Iga, it's a lot different," Rybakina said. "Marta is coming forward, trying to take the ball early. She moves well. But still, the speed is different, and I was focusing not to rush, also to try to open the angle."

Facing down a confident Rybakina turned out to be a bridge too far for Kostyuk, who engineered a groundbreaking week in Stuttgart to make her second final of the year. In the midst of the best season of her career, Kostyuk will rise to a new career-high ranking of No.21 on Monday. 

The 21-year-old Ukrainian came into Sunday having tallied three straight Top 10 wins, defeating No.7 Zheng Qinwen, and reigning Slam champions No.3 Coco Gauff, and No.9 Marketa Vondrousova. Her win over Zheng in the Round of 16 was a remarkable one. Kostyuk saved five match points in stunning fashion to oust the Australian Open finalist. 



"Every morning I didn't know what to expect from myself on the court today," Kostyuk said, "because really me being able to pull off this whole week and play an amazing tennis yesterday was something incredible and something I would never expect I can do.

"But today, obviously I was very nervous. I wanted to win a lot this one, and yeah, I think there were a lot of things together. Yeah, I just couldn't probably bear it anymore."

Coming into the final with a 1-1 record against Rybakina, Kostyuk could find no inroads against the World No.4. Kostyuk struck just six unforced errors in the first set, but Rybakina's baseline aggression extracted 16 forced errors. 

Rybakina continued her momentum in the second set to close out the win after 1 hour and 9 minutes. She finished the match unbroken, saving all three break points she faced.

Marton Fucsovics is back in the winners’ circle.

The Hungarian earned his second ATP Tour title on Sunday when he defeated rising Argentine Mariano Navone 6-4, 7-5 in the final of the Tiriac Open.

Former champions at the Bucharest ATP 250 event, which was played for the first time since 2016, include David Ferrer, Gilles Simon, Grigor Dimitrov and Fernando Verdasco. Now Fucsovics’ name is on the list.

“It feels really good. It’s been a long time since I’ve won an ATP 250 tournament, so it’s a great feeling,” Fucsovics said. “I was working really hard for it. Today was a tough one, but I was fighting until the end.”


Also a tour-level champion in Geneva in 2018, Fucsovics defeated three of the top five seeds in Bucharest to emerge victorious. He overcame a tenacious Navone in a gruelling two hours and six minutes to lift the trophy.

It was a special week in Romania for the No. 82 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, who will climb to World No. 53 on Monday.

“At some point, I felt like playing at home,” Fucsovics said. “Thanks for everyone coming out and supporting me, supporting us. Thank you.”



Fucsovics, who six years ago became the first Hungarian tour-level titlist since Balazs Taroczy at Hilversum in 1982, lost just one set this week. But despite the straight-sets scoreline, the championship clash proved a tough battle.

The 32-year-old Fucsovics came out firing from the baseline to surge to a 4-0 lead. But Navone, who had not played a tour-level match before the season and reached his first ATP Tour final in February in Rio de Janeiro, dug into the red clay and clawed back on serve.

At 4-4, Navone held break point to fully seize the momentum, but Fucsovics moved forward and hit a short forehand volley to get out of trouble. In the next game, his Argentine opponent missed back-to-back inside-out forehands wide to relinquish the set.

Navone battled back in the second set, leading by a break and looking in good position to force a decider. But Fucsovics stormed back and raised his arms to celebrate after Navone missed a final shot long to end the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

The champion won 48 per cent of his return points and converted five of his eight break points according to Infosys ATP Stats.

The fifth-seeded Navone fell short of winning his first ATP Tour title, but he will crack the Top 50 Monday for the first time at World No. 41. The 23-year-old began the year at World No. 125.

BMW Open: Munich, Germany: April 15th - April 21th,2024

Jan-Lennard Struff banished past championship-match heartache in style on Sunday at the BMW Open in Munich.

The German overcame World No. 15 Taylor Fritz 7-5, 6-3 to lift his maiden ATP Tour title at the clay-court ATP 250. The fourth-seeded Struff entered the final with an 0-3 record in tour-level finals, but he showed no sign of nerves in front of his home fans en route to sealing a 79-minute triumph.

“[It feels] unbelievable, and to do it on home soil is just incredible,” said Struff in his post-match interview. “I waited so long. I’m 33 years old and played so long on Tour. It’s just an amazing feeling to do it here in Germany.”


Aged 33 years and 11 months, Struff became the third-oldest first-time champion since the ATP Tour was established in 1990. The pivotal moments in Struff’s victory came in the first set, when he faced two set points on his own serve at 4-5, 15/40, and then another at 40/Ad. From there, the home favourite reeled off 11 points in a row to take the set.

Struff and Fritz’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash on clay was played out in damp, cold conditions. The temperature dropped as low as 3 degrees Celsius during the championship match but that did not prevent the German bringing some real fire to the court. Just as he had in his semi-final upset of second seed Holger Rune, Struff used his powerful forehand to dictate rallies against a similarly high-powered opponent.

The home favourite clinched his victory with a powerful smash before immediately raising his arms in celebration to his team. He converted five of 11 break points he earned against Fritz, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to complete a dominant week on home soil in which he did not drop a set.

With his triumph, Struff improved to 16-8 in Munich, where he also reached the final in 2021. The German’s other tour-level finals both came in 2023, when he lost to Carlos Alcaraz as a lucky loser in the Madrid championship match and held a match point against Frances Tiafoe in Stuttgart before also falling to defeat.

Struff will on Monday rise four spots to No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings as a result of his Munich title run, just three spots shy of his career high. He has the chance to add another trophy to his cabinet later on Sunday, when he takes to court alongside countryman Andreas Mies in the doubles final against Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti.

“One more to go. I hope we can go all the way in the final now," said Struff of the doubles final. "I played good tennis this week, I’m very happy. I beat good guys and I’m just unbelievably happy that I did it today.”
