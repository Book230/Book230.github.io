No.2 seed Renata Zarazua of Mexico captured the WTA 125 Montevideo Open singles title by edging past No.1 seed Diane Parry 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in Sunday's final.



With the comeback win, 26-year-old Zarazua takes home the first WTA 125 title of her career. She had previously been a runner-up on the hard courts of WTA 125 Concord, losing that final to Magdalena Frech.

Zarazua also moves up to a new career-high ranking of No.105 in Monday's update.


Zarazua cruised through her first three rounds this week, but she had to survive a battle in Saturday's semifinals. In that clash, Zarazua led Maria Lourdes Carle 4-1 in the third set before Carle surged and served for the match at 5-4. Zarazua rebounded by winning the next three games to advance to the final.


Sunday's final was similarly back-and-forth.

In Saturday's Montevideo Open doubles final, the unseeded all-Argentine pairing of Maria Lourdes Carle and Julia Riera defeated No.4 seeds Freya Christie and Yuliana Lizarazo 7-6(5), 7-5 to claim the title.

Carle and Riera beat three seeded teams on their way to the title, and they did not drop a set in all four of their wins this week. They took 1 hour and 44 minutes to topple Christie of Great Britain and Colombia's Lizarazo in the final.

Carle is on an eight-match winning streak in doubles, having won two WTA 125 doubles titles in a two-week span. Carle won her first career WTA 125 doubles title alongside Despina Papamichail in Buenos Aires last week. As for Riera, this is her first career WTA 125 title.
