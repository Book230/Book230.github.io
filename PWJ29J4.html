								WTA player to 1/29 to 2/4/24: Diana Shnaider 
							</h5> 
							<img src=" Diana.jpg" alt=" Shnaider" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
							<p class="card-text">
							    Diana came into this tournament with not that much confidence. She had not made it past the 1st round in her last 3 tournaments. Diana last year had made one final in Ningbo where she lost to Jabeur.  
							
		Additionally,Diana hasn't been in tour for that long since for a little while she went to NC State to play tennis. In this tournament, Diana played 5 matches, 3 of which were versus the top 3 seeds. In the 1st round she beat Magda Linette the number one seed and former champion of the tournament in 3 sets. In the 2nd round,she beat Paula Badosa of Spain through a walkover. In the quarter final, she beat Dalma Galfi of Hungary easily in straight sets. In the semi-final, she beat 3rd seeded Wang Xinyu of China in straights sets. In the final, she beat number 2 seeded Zhu Lin of China, who was the defending champion in 3 sets. Overall, this week allowed Shnaider to get back into the top 100 and to get closer to her career high which she reached last year. 					    						</p>

							ATP player for 1/29 to 2/4/24: Alexander Bublik	
							</h5> 
								<img src="Bublik.jpg" alt=" Alexander" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
							<p class="card-text">
							  Alexander had won the title prior in 2022. In that final he beat the number one seed who was Alexander Zverev to claim his first title. This year Bublik had to come back in all of his matches. In the tournament he was seeded second. He only had to play 4 matches due to him being one of the top 4 seeds. In his 1st round he had to come back against Denis Shapovalov a Canadian who was coming back from injury. In his second round or the quarter final, he came back from a set down to defeat Alexander Schevchenko who was a fellow  Kazhanstani like himself. 
							  In the semi finals, he played another Canadian Felix Auger Alliasime who has had a rough past year and a half. In this years final, he beat 4th seeded Borna Coric of Croatia. This allowed him to reach his career high of 23 and to obtain his first title of the season, but the 4th over all.   </p>
