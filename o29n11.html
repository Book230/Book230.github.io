								WTA player for 10/29 to 11/5/23: Beatriz Haddad Maia 
							</h5>
							<p class="card-text">
							This year, Beatriz has been having one of her best seasons. At Roland Garros she made it to the semi- finals and the fourth round at Wimbeldon. Additionally, she has made many quarters and semi finals at lower tournaments such as the Abu Dhabi Open, Qatar Open, Stuggart Open, Italian Open, and at the San Diego Open. This gave Beatriz a lot of confidence coming into the Wta Zhuhai Trophy. Beatriz qualified for both the singles and doubles of this tournament. The tournament was played in Zhuhai, China and was from October 24 - October 29.  Beatriz in total played a total of 7 combining her singles and doubles. Beatriz ended up winning both. This took a lot of mental and physical strength and is very impressive .

							ATP player for 10/29 to 11/5/23: Felix Auger Aliassime 	
							</h5>
							<p class="card-text">
								This year, Felix has been very rough. Felix has had many injuries and illnesses. This caused Felix to not have as much confidence in his playing, inconsistent results, and not as many tournaments or matches. Felix had a lot of pressure coming into Basel which took place from October 21- October 29 because he was the defending champion. During the tournament, Felix had to play 5 matches which he won all of them, but his quarter final versus Alexander Shevchenko of Khazhstan was his hardest, he had to come back from the brink in that match and had to save countless match points. This gave Felix a lot of confidence going into his semi final and finals match, which allowed him to win .
