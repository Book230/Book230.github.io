							ATP player for 10/29 to 11/5/23 : Felix Auger Aliassime 	
							</h5>
							<p class="card-text">
								This year , Felix has been very rough . Felix has had many injuries and illnesses . This caused Felix to not have as much confidence in his playing , inconsistent results , and not as many tournaments or matches . Felix had a lot of pressure coming into Basel which took place from October 21- October 29 because he was the defending champion . During the tournament , Felix had to play 5 matches which he won all of them , but his quarter final versus Alexander Shevchenko of Russia was his hardest , he had to come back from the brink in that match and had to save countless match points . This gave Felix a lot of confidence going into his semi final and finals match , which allowed him to win .
