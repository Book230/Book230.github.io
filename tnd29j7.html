Germany completed a memorable comeback in the early hours of Monday morning to stun Poland 2-1 in Sydney for the United Cup trophy.

After Alexander Zverev saved two championship points against Hubert Hurkacz, Zverev returned to Ken Rosewall Arena alongside Laura Siegemund to defeat Hurkacz and WTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek 6-4, 5-7, 10-4 for all the glory at 12:45 a.m.

Germany battled from behind throughout the competition. The country finished second in Group D and scraped into the quarter-finals based on percentage of games won. Siegemund and Zverev won deciding mixed doubles matches on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to ultimately lift the trophy.


In Saturday's semi-finals, Angelique Kerber saved two match points against Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic and Siegemund/Zverev saved two match points against Matthew Ebden and Storm Hunter in a match that ended later than 2:15 a.m.

Germany was on the verge of elimination again in the championship match when Poland's Hurkacz had the title on his racquet at 6/4 in the second-set tie-break. Zverev saved two match points to force the deciding mixed doubles.


In the second set, Hurkacz was broken when serving to force a decider, but the Poles showed resilience by breaking to win the set at 6-5.

But Germany surged to the lead early on in the Match Tie-break and the Poles, who won 12 of their 15 matches in the 2024 United Cup, were unable to battle back.


Just 20 hours after Zverev led Germany to the United Cup final by winning a deciding mixed doubles match with Siegemund against Australia, the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion kept his country’s dreams alive once again on Sunday.

Zverev saved two match points to stun Hurkacz 6-7(3), 7-6(6), 6-4, forcing a deciding mixed doubles in the championship clash against Poland. WTA No. 1 Swiatek defeated Kerber earlier in the evening. 

Hurkacz had the advantage when he walked into Ken Rosewall Arena despite trailing Zverev 0-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Zverev had played a gruelling three-set singles match Saturday evening against Alex de Minaur and then three sets in doubles.


 Despite showing signs of fatigue at the end of the second set and suffering from the onset of cramps early in the third, Zverev found a way to win against the big-serving Pole.

Hurkacz hit 19 aces according to Infosys ATP Stats and saved the first six break points he faced. But Zverev’s serve proved even more dominant, as the German did not face a break point.

Zverev saved one match point at 4/6 in the second-set tie-break with a stunning forehand passing shot that barely clipped the line. Hurkacz then let slip another opportunity to lift the trophy by missing a neutral crosscourt backhand wide.

After earning the lone service break of the match at 3-3 in the decider, Zverev successfully held the rest of the way to thrill the Sydney fans keen for more action.


World No.1 Swiatek gave Poland the early lead in the final after defeating former No.1 Angelique Kerber 6-3, 6-0 in the opening rubber. Swiatek's victory was her fifth of the week. 

Hubert Hurkacz will look to seal the win for Poland when he faces Alexander Zverev in the second singles match.




Swiatek and Kerber had not played since their first meeting, which came amid Swiatek's 37-match win streak in 2022. Then, in the Round of 16 at Indian Wells, the soon-to-be World No.1 came from a set down to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. Swiatek came into the match boasting a 17-2 record against left-handed players over the last three seasons, including a perfect 7-0 last year.

As the match began, Kerber showed no signs of any physical hangover from her late-night finish. The former No.1 earned a physical win over Ajla Tomljanovic to help Germany defeat Australia in the semifinals on Saturday night, with the tie finishing at 2:20 a.m. As she slung her forehand with depth and precision, Kerber put early pressure on Swiatek, who gamely saved two break points to hold to 3-2. 

The match remained in the balance in the balance until Swiatek engineered the only break of the set. After saving three more break points on her own serve, Swiatek overpowered the Kerber serve to break to 5-3 and serve out the set. Swiatek finished the set with 21 groundstroke winners to 13 unforced errors. Kerber struck 11 winners to six unforced errors.

Ever the front-runner, Swiatek would run off a streak of nine consecutive games to complete a 70-minute win and maintain her perfect start to the season.

	Brisbane International presented by Evie : Brisbane , Australia : December 31 - Jan 7 , 2024 
		<img src=" Brisbane Open.jpg" alt=" Brisbane" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
World No.4 Elena Rybakina captured her sixth career title and first of the season at the Brisbane International, defeating No.2 Aryna Sabalenka 6-0, 6-3 in the final on Sunday. The victory ended Sabalenka's 15-match win streak on Australian soil, a streak that began last year with her wins in Adelaide and the Australian Open.


This was a rematch of that Australian Open final. Rybakina turned the tables, capping  off a flawless opening week with a strong performance to dominate the top seed. The victory is Elena's third hard-court title and first since defeating Sabalenka to win Indian Wells last spring. It is also her second title in Australia, having won her first WTA title in Hobart in 2020.



Rivalry renewed: Sabalenka and Rybakina came into Sunday's final having not lost a set in Brisbane. Rybakina trailed the head-to-head 5-2 but the two split their four meetings last season. Sabalenka got the wins at the start and end of the season, beating Rybakina in Melbourne and in round-robin play at the WTA Finals in Cancun. But Rybakina snagged her first two wins over Sabalenka in Indian Wells and the Beijing quarterfinals. 

All five of Sabalenka's wins came in three sets. Both of Rybakina's came in two. Rybakina's trend continued in Brisbane.

Asb Classic: Auckland,New Zealand: Jan 1 - Jan 7 , 2024 
		<img src=" Asb Classic.jpg" alt=" Auckland" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
   No.1 seed Coco Gauff successfully defended her ASB Classic title by prevailing over No.2 Elina Svitolina 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-3 in Sunday’s final at the WTA 250 event.


Gauff of the United States shook off the loss of a topsy-turvy first set before notching the victory over Svitolina in 2 hours and 35 minutes of play. Gauff won the seventh Hologic WTA Tour singles title of her career in the process.

 Reigning US Open champion Gauff has now won 10 straight matches at the ASB Classic after yet another victory on the hard courts of Auckland, New Zealand.

World No.3 Gauff’s perfect set-winning record over the last two editions of the event ended when she dropped Sunday’s first-set tiebreak, but she is still 20-1 in sets at the tournament during her two title runs.

Gauff is the fourth player to win back-to-back WTA titles at the ASB Classic, joining Patty Fendick (1988 and 1989), Eleni Daniilidou (2003 and 2004) and Julia Goerges (2018 and 2019). 


The 19-year-old improved to 7-1 in WTA finals in her career. Gauff also continued her excellent record on hard courts of late  since the start of last summer’s hard-court season, she has a 29-4 win-loss record on the surface.

Svitolina, last season’s WTA Comeback Player of the Year, has a superb record in WTA finals as well, but she suffered a rare loss at that stage on Sunday. Former World No.3 Svitolina, who came back from maternity leave just nine months ago and is already back in the Top 25, has a 17-4 career win-loss record in finals.

 Gauff had lost her only previous meeting with Svitolina at the 2021 Australian Open, but the American started Sunday's match well, breaking for a 5-3 first-set lead with a forehand passing winner. However, Svitolina erased two set points in the next game, then hit a passing winner of her own to extend the opener.

Svitolina took advantage of that opportunity, cruising to a 6-2 lead in the first-set tiebreak. Svitolina needed three set points but ultimately snapped Gauff’s 18-set winning streak in Auckland.



In doubles ,  No.2 seeds Anna Danilina and Viktoria Hruncakova squeaked past No.1 seeds Marie Bouzkova and Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3, 6-7(5), [10-8] in 1 hour and 45 minutes to win the ASB Classic doubles title.

It is the fifth career WTA doubles title each for Danilina and Hruncakova, but their first as a team.

Workday Canberra International : Canberra , Australia: Jan 1 - Jan 6 , 2024 
		<img src=" Canberra International.jpg" alt=" Canberra" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
A resurgent Nuria Parrizas Diaz claimed the third WTA 125 title of her career at the Workday Canberra International after defeating Harriet Dart 6-4, 6-3 in a 1-hour, 36-minute final.


Parrizas Diaz's trio of WTA 125 trophies have all come on different surfaces. The 32-year-old was previously the champion at Bastad (clay) and Columbus (indoor hard courts) in 2021, the year she became the fifth-oldest player to debut in the Top 100 since the start of the WTA Rankings. Parrizas Diaz hit a career-high of No.45 in March 2022, but struggled with injuries in 2023 -- missing two months between Wimbledon and the US Open -- and had slipped to No.123 this week.

The Spaniard dropped just one set en route to her biggest title on outdoor hard courts, defeating No.5 seed Kamilla Rakhimova 6-4, 0-6, 6-3 in the second round. Her run also included a first-round win over fast-rising 18-year-old Celine Naef 6-3, 6-1, and a 6-4, 7-6(3) semifinal triumph over heavy-hitting Clara Tauson.


No.120-ranked Dart had needed to go to three sets in three out of four matches to reach her first WTA 125 final. The unseeded 27-year-old came through 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 against Anna-Lena Friedsam in her opener and ousted No.6 seed Wang Yafan 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 in the second round before upsetting No.2 seed Nao Hibino 6-3, 6-0 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Dart triumphed in the longest match of the tournament, defeating Katie Volynets 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 over 3 hours and 14 minutes.


Tauson, 21, put together another positive week as she bids to re-establish herself in the Top 100. The Dane reached a career-high of No.33 in 2022 after winning her first two Hologic WTA Tour titles the previous year, but has struggled with injuries since.

In Canberra, Tauson took out No.1 seed Viktorija Golubic 6-2, 6-4 in the first round, and took that momentum all the way to the semifinals.

Teenage wild card Maya Joint enjoyed the best week of her young career so far on home soil. The 17-year-old, making her debut at WTA 125 level, upset No.8 seed Sara Errani 6-2, 6-3 in the first round and backed that up by defeating fellow teen Ella Seidel 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 to make the quarterfinals -- the first two Top 200 wins of her career.

No.684-ranked Joint's run was ended by Tauson 6-4, 6-2 in the last eight, but the U.S.-born Australian will get another opportunity to show off her skills after receiving a wild card to Australian Open qualifying this coming week.




In doubles ,the unseeded duo of Veronika Erjavec and Darja Semenistaja lifted the doubles trophy after defeating home pair Kaylah McPhee and Astra Sharma 6-2, 6-4 in the final. Erjavec, of Slovenia, and Semenistaja, of Latvia, were playing together for the first time.

The title was the 21-year-old Semenistaja's first at WTA 125 level, and Erjavec's second. The 24-year-old was previously the 2023 Iasi 125 champion alongside Dalila Jakupovic.

	Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open: Hong Kong , Hong Kong : Jan 1 - Jan 7 , 2024 
		<img src=" Hong Kong Open.jpg" alt=" Hong Kong" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
			<p>
Andrey Rublev captured his 15th tour-level title and 10th on hard courts on Sunday at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open, where he defeated Finn Emil Ruusuvuori, who was chasing his maiden tour-level crown.

In a heavy-hitting final, Rublev earned a 6-4, 6-4 victory at the ATP 250 event to start his season in style. With his 78-minute victory, the 26-year-old improved to 3-1 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series, gaining revenge for his defeat to Ruusuvuori in Cincinnati in August.

Rublev has won his past nine matches against players outside the Top 50 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings, with his last defeat coming against Ruusuvuori.

Top seed Rublev was made to work hard for the title in Hong Kong, where the ATP Tour returned for the first time since 2002 this week. He moved past #NextGenATP stars Shang Juncheng and Arthur Fils in deciding sets, but had too much for Ruusuvuori. He struck 13 winners, committed just six unforced errors and saved the one break point he faced.

Ruusuvuori was competing in his second tour-level final, having fallen to Joao Sousa in Pune in 2022. The 24-year-old is up 19 spots to No. 50 in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings following his run in Hong Kong.
