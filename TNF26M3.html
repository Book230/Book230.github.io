Acapulco Open: Acapulco,Mexico:Feb 25 - March 2,2024

Alex de Minaur secured a first trophy to show for his excellent start to the 2024 season on Saturday night in Acapulco, where the Australian downed Casper Ruud to successfully defend his title at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC.

The third-seeded De Minaur prevailed 6-4, 6-4 in the championship match at the ATP 500 to clinch his eighth ATP Tour crown. He converted three of four break points he earned in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Ruud since he defeated the Norwegian at the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals, and ultimately wrapped a one-hour, 57-minute victory for a second straight triumph on the Mexican Pacific Coast.



De Minaur outhit Ruud by 27 winners to eight, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Despite making just 53 per cent of first serves, the Australian was crucially able to win 74 per cent (20/27) of points behind his second delivery. He is the first player to successfully defend the title in Acapulco since the tournament switched to hard courts in 2014, and is now 11-2 at the event since making his debut in 2019.

One of the highlights of De Minaur’s triumph was a stunning all-court point in the penultimate game of the match. He showcased the lightning movement and defensive defiance that has already earned him four Top 10 wins in 2024 to outlast Ruud in a point he barely had the right to win.


With his title run, De Minaur ensured he will on Monday remain in the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings. Despite defeating Ruud in Saturday’s final, the Australian will drop one spot below the Norwegian to No. 10. He is up three spots in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, however — De Minaur now sits third behind Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev.


The Monegasque Hugo Nys and the Polish Jan Zielinski were proclaimed champions of the doubles tournament of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presented by HSBC, which took place in the hard courts of the tennis complex of the GNP Arena.

Nys and Zielinski did not give any chance to the duo formed by the Mexican Santiago Gonzalez and the British Neil Skupsky, despite the locality enjoyed by the player from Veracruz and his partner during the whole tournament, to subdue them by 6-3, 6-2 in just one hour and nine minutes of match.

As reflected in the scoreboard, the now champions clearly did things better against opponents who, except for a moment in the first set, failed to settle in the center court and ended up being clearly outclassed.

Santi, finalists for the second time in Acapulco, had arrived with many illusions to Saturday’s final, without dropping a single set throughout the tournament, however, they were powerless against Nys and Zielinski, who were a gale from start to finish.

Nys and Zielinski started with a very good rhythm, to take a 3-0 lead in the first set with a break to Gonzalez. However, the rivals reacted with the support of the crowd to equalize at three games apiece, in what was their only important moment of the match.

Again, Nys and Zielinski took control of the actions and stepped on the accelerator to win the set 6-3, being clear dominators of the match. 

In the second set, there was not the reaction that the fans expected from their favorite players. If in the first set, the game was one-sided, in the second the dominance was more overwhelming to quickly define the match with a 6-2 score, without showing a crack through which their opponents could sneak through.

			The French No. 5 seed dispatches seventh-seeded Kazakh, 6-4, 6-3, to win sixth career title
Tallon Griekspoor and Jan-Lennard Struff claim men’s doubles title with 6-4, 4-6, [10-6] victory over Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek
Dubai, UAE—March 2, 2024: Ugo Humbert produced a ruthless masterclass to defeat Kazakhstan’s Alexander Bublik in straight sets and seal ATP 500 victory in the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships tonight.

The French No5 seed, who rises to a career-high world No. 14 after his heroics in Dubai, made it a clean sweep of six titles in six ATP finals with a clinical 6-4, 6-3 dismantling of No. 7 seed Bublik, the World No19, in front of a capacity Centre Court crowd at Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium.



Humbert, who defeated compatriot Gael Monfils, Britain’s Andy Murray, world No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and world No. 4 Daniil Medvedev to reach the final, unleashed his full repertoire of booming forehands and laser-like double-handed backhands to eclipse Bublik, who progressed past 2022 Dubai champion Andrey Rublev in a dramatic semifinal, which saw the No. 2 seed defaulted for unsportsmanlike conduct.

After tight opening exchanges where the pair were evenly matched, the final stayed on-serve until the tenth game when Humbert, who had failed to convert break points in Bublik’s two previous service games, finally broke the Kazakh’s resistance to clinch the first set 6-4.


With Bublik delighting the Dubai crowd with a combination of whipped forehands and a deft array of dropshots, Humbert, relaxed and controlled, raced into a 3-1 second set lead after breaking Bublik. From there, the 25-year-old left-hander relied on his own dominant serve—unbroken throughout the final—to close out the match on his second championship point.

In the men’s doubles final, the Netherlands’ Tallon Griekspoor and Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff narrowly defeated Croatia’s Ivan Dodig and the USA’s Austin Krajicek, 6-4, 4-6, [10-6]. With a pair of service breaks enough to settle the opening two sets, Griekspoor and Struff came from 1-3 down in the deciding super tiebreak, winning nine of the last 12 points to claim a maiden Dubai title and shared prize pool of US$180,700. Beaten finalists Dodig and Krajicek share a runners-up purse of US$96,370.

No.8 seed Yuan Yue won the first Hologic WTA Tour title of her career at the ATX Open on Sunday, battling past No.6 seed Wang Xiyu 6-4, 7-6(4) in a gripping all-Chinese final.



The 25-year-old Yuan triumphed after 2 hours and 13 minutes, holding off a tremendous comeback by her 22-year-old countrywoman Wang, who trailed 5-2 in the second set.

Yuan finally prevailed on her seventh championship point, taking home the title in her second career WTA final. Yuan finished runner-up to Jessica Pegula at Seoul last October.

Sunday's clash was the first all-Chinese final since Wang Qiang defeated Zheng Saisai for the 2018 Nanchang title. Moreover, it was the first all-Chinese final to take place outside of Asia since 2006, when Zheng Jie defeated Li Na to take the title in Estoril, Portugal.



 Yuan came back from 2-0 down to claim the first set, finishing it off with an unreturned forehand. Yuan erased five of the six break points she faced in the opener, while converting both of her own break points.

World No.68 Yuan kept the momentum in the early stages of the second set, sweeping to a 5-2 lead. Yuan could not serve out the match in that game, but she garnered three consecutive championship points on Wang’s serve at 5-3, 0-40.

However, clutch serving helped 64th-ranked Wang get out of that jam, and she made a stirring comeback from there. Wang reeled off four straight games to lead 6-5 in the set before Yuan righted her ship to line up a tiebreak.


Yuan was the dominant force to start the tiebreak, jumping ahead 6-1 and grabbing five more championship points. Once again, Wang fought back, saving three more match points, but Yuan at last converted her seventh chance to polish off the victory.

Wang had more winners on the day, with 20 to Yuan's 14. However, Yuan had 12 fewer unforced errors than Wang in the final.
				The doubles title was guaranteed to go to a team playing in their maiden tournament together as Austin was a first for both duos.

After defeating the tournament’s second-seeded team in the quarters and advancing to the final via walkover on Saturday, Olivia Gadecki and Olivia Nicholls proved their worth, defeating Katarzyna Kawa and Bibiane Schoofs, in two sets.

The Olivia’s cruised in the first set but Kawa and Schoofs battled back in the second jumping out to a 4-0 game lead. But, their resurgence was short-lived and the crowd was treated to a counter-comeback as the Olivia’s won six straight games to claim their first title in their first tournament together 6-2, 6-4.

The win is a first for Gadecki and marked the second of Nicholls’ career.

			 Santiago Open :Santiago,Chile:February 24 - March 2,2024
		<img src="Santiago Open.jpg" alt="Doha" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

Sebastian Baez finished his South American clay-court swing on a high Sunday in Santiago.

The Argentine rallied past home favourite Alejandro Tabilo 3-6, 6-0, 6-4 in the final of the Movistar Chile Open to secure his second title in as many weeks. Last week Baez triumphed at the ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro.

The 23-year-old has won nine consecutive matches and will climb to a career-high No. 19 in the PIF ATP Rankings Monday. He found his best tennis when it mattered most on Court Jaime Fillol, earning 12 of the championship clash’s final 16 games to emerge victorious after two hours and 14 minutes.




Baez’s winning streak appeared in jeopardy when this year’s Auckland champion Tabilo made a quick start in front of a partisan crowd. Chants of “Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le! Viva Chile!” filled the air as day turned to night and the lefty moved to within a set of earning his second ATP Tour crown.

Tabilo also was able to draw confidence from the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting last year in Cordoba, which he won in straight sets. But one of the key differences in this encounter was how Baez performed under pressure.

When the pair met in Cordoba, the Argentine saved just one of the six break points he faced. In Santiago, he saved eight of 10 break points while converting five of his 16 opportunities according to Infosys ATP Stats.



After an uncharacteristically out-of-rhythm start from Baez, he locked in from the back of the court for the final two sets. Many rallies were grinding duels from behind the baseline and in those situations, Tabilo was unable to consistently find ways to put his opponent under duress.

The Chilean found his moments and hit some jaw-dropping shots, including a stunning backhand down the line to help him break back when Baez served for the match at 5-3 in the deciding set.

But the second seed was able to successfully ride those waves of momentum and rely on his heavy forehand to control the action. Despite losing serve on the verge of victory, he broke in the next game, hitting a final forehand winner to capture his fifth title since the start of the 2023 season.

Baez is now fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is 16-5 in 2024. He is trying to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time.

Baez became the first player to win multiple titles during the South American clay-court swing since Cristian Garin in 2020.

			San Diego Open :San Diego,California: February 24 - March 3,2024
		<img src="San Diego Open.jpg" alt="Dubai" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Katie Boulter of Great Britain won the second and highest-level Hologic WTA Tour title of her career on Sunday, fighting past No.6 seed Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 to claim the Cymbiotika San Diego Open crown.

Boulter needed 2 hours and 13 minutes to power past Kostyuk in their first meeting and notch her first WTA 500 title. Boulter's previous title came last summer, when she triumphed in her home country on the grass courts of WTA 250 Nottingham.




 Currently ranked No.49, Boulter is the lowest-ranked player to win a WTA 500 title since then-No.106 Liudmila Samsonova won 2021 Berlin. With the title, Boulter is projected to hit a new career-high ranking of No.27, shattering her previous career-high of No.48.

All five of Boulter's victories at the Cymbiotika San Diego Open have been over Top 50 opposition, increasing her career tally of Top 50 wins from nine to 14 in the span of a week.

Boulter is the second Brit to capture a WTA 500 title, joining former World No.4 Johanna Konta, who hoisted WTA 500 trophies at 2016 Stanford and 2017 Sydney.


 Boulter made her first move in the opening set, where she charged from 5-2 down to 5-5, saving five set points in that run. However, Kostyuk blasted her way to a hold for 6-5, and Boulter hit her sixth double fault of the set on the Ukrainian’s seventh set point.

Boulter came out firing again in the second set, cracking a forehand winner down the line to lead 3-1. Boulter broke Kostyuk for the third time in the set to lead 5-2, and she served out the set routinely to level the match. Boulter won 60 percent of points on return in the second set.


The 27-year-old Boulter kept her momentum up in the decider, breaking Kostyuk for a 2-1 lead for the third consecutive set. The Brit slammed a return winner to break Kostyuk once more for 5-2, and Boulter hit her first two aces of the day in the next game en route to victory.

All told, Boulter converted seven of her 11 break points in the final, while also saving seven of the 11 break points she faced.


Melichar-Martinez, Perez cruise to doubles crown: No.3 seeds Nicole Melichar-Martinez of the United States and Ellen Perez of Australia won the Cymbiotika San Diego Open doubles title with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over No.1 seeds Desirae Krawczyk and Jessica Pegula in Sunday's final.

Melichar-Martinez and Perez needed just 58 minutes to dispatch the top seeds and win their second title as a partnership. Their previous team title came at 2022 Cleveland. Overall, Melichar-Martinez has won 13 WTA doubles titles, and Perez has won six.

The victors won nearly 80 percent of their first-service points on Sunday, while also capturing 68 percent of points when returning the No.1 seeds' second serves. Melichar-Martinez and Perez converted five of their 13 break points and dropped serve only once.
