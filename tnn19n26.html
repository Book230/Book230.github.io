 Ajla Tomljanovic's comeback from injury was sucessful, when the she defeated Argentina's Martina Capurro Taborda 6-1, 7-5 to win the WTA 125 MundoTenis Open title in Florianopolis,Brazil.

Tomljanovic took 1 hour and 48 minutes to win in the final, holding off a second-set run by World No.194 Capurro Taborda.

This is 30-year-old Tomljanovic's highest-level singles title, although she has made three Grand Slam quarterfinals and four Hologic WTA Tour finals. It is also her first singles title at any level since she won her fourth career ITF Challenger title ten years ago.

Tomljanovic had been on fire at the end of 2022, reaching Grand Slam quarterfinals at both Wimbledon and the US Open that season. During that US Open run, she defeated Serena Williams in the 23-time Grand Slam champion's final match of her career.

At the start of 2023, Tomljanovic had to withdraw from all events in her home country of Australia due to a knee injury. Despite reaching a career-high ranking of No.32 in April,Tomljanovic did not play a match for the first seven months of this year.


Tomljanovic returned to action at the US Open in August, and she held a win-loss record of 2-3 for the year coming into Florianopolis. She started this week at a ranking of No.543 and took a wild card into the MundoTenis Open draw.

Tomljanovic grinded through her first two matches of the week, including saving four match points in her second-round victory over Ipek Oz. But after surviving that tussle, Tomljanovic eased through the rest of the draw, winning her next three matches without the loss of a set.


In Saturday's doubles final, Italy's Sara Errani and Leolia Jeanjean of France claimed the title with a 7-5, 3-6, [10-7] victory over Julia Lohoff of Germany and Switzerland's Conny Perrin. 

Errani and Jeanjean needed 1 hour and 25 minutes to hold off their opponents and get rid of Lohoff and Perrin's seven-match winning streak. Lohoff and Perrin won last week's WTA 125 doubles title in Colina,Chile.

Errani, a former World No.1 in doubles and World No.5 in singles, won her second career WTA 125 doubles title this week, to go alongside her 43 Hologic WTA Tour doubles titles - including the Career Grand Slam. Jeanjean won her first WTA 125 doubles title this week.

				Davis Cup: Malaga, Spain : November 21-26

		<p> 
		Jannik Sinner has put end to his amazing 2023 season by leading Italy to its first Davis Cup title since 1976 after defeating Australian Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-0 in Malaga on Sunday night.

Sinner saved three match points to defeat World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in Saturday's semi-finals,but on Sunday Sinner converted the 1-0 lead provided by Matteo Arnaldi's three-set win over Alexei Popyrin into a championship-clinching result with his crushing victory over De Minaur. 


De Minaur began the match with an aggressive love service hold, but then just won  two more games against an imperious Sinner.Sinner was hitting with ferocious power off both wings.

Sinner, 22, finishes the year with a personal-best 64-15 record on the season and at a year-end career-high No. 4 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings.

Earlier in the day Arnaldi gave Italy a 1-0 lead after staring down eight break points in the deciding set against Popyrin.

In contrast to the opportunities missed by Popyrin, the 22-year-old seized the moment when presented with his first match point in the 10th game of the 3rd set to close out a 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 victory in two hours and 27 minutes.


Italian captain Filippo Volandri, who oversaw Italy's second Davis Cup title run, said, "Really thankful to have these guys. Really proud to have these guys. You've been here for all these two years and I really have to say thanks to the crowds, to Italy, for all the support they gave us. We had to manage with a lot of emergencies in these two years, but we did it and we did it like a family."
