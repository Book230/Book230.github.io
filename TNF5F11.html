LAT Mumbai Open: Mumbai,India: Feb 5 - Feb 11,2024
		<img src=" Mumbai Open.jpg" alt="India" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
No.6 seed Darja Semenistaja of Latvia came back from a set and a break down and saved a championship point on the way to her first WTA 125 singles title at the L & T Mumbai Open.


Semenistaja defeated Australia's Storm Hunter 5-7, 7-6(6), 6-2 in Sunday's final to capture the highest-level singles title of her career. The 21-year-old was a point away from defeat in the second-set tiebreak, but held on for the comeback win after two-and-a-half hours of play.

Ranked World No.121 and the Latvian No.2 behind Jelena Ostapenko, Semenistaja had already garnered a measure of WTA 125 success this year, when she won the doubles title alongside Veronika Erjavec at WTA 125 Canberra in January.

In January, she captured one ITF Challenger singles title and two ITF Challenger doubles titles in India.


In an all-left-handed final, Semenistaja served for the first set at 5-3 and had four set points on Hunter's serve at 5-4.

 Hunter, who finished last year ranked World No.1 in doubles, buckled down to erase all of those set points, and won four games in a row to steal the opening set.

In the second set, Hunter came back from 4-2 down and served for the championship at 5-4. Hunter did not take that opportunity, but she got an even bigger chance in the second-set tiebreak when she fired a forehand winner to line up championship point at 6-5.

However, Hunter netted her service return to change ends at 6-6. On the next point, Semenistaja drew a Hunter backhand error to grab her first set point at 7-6. There, Semenistaja slammed a forehand winner down the line to swipe the second set from championship point down.

Semenistaja took control after that. In the third set, the Latvian broke Hunter twice and never faced a break point. Semenistaja ended the match the same way she ended the second set -- with a down-the-line forehand winner.


 No.2 seeds Dalila Jakupovic of Slovenia and American Sabrina Santamaria won the L & T Mumbai Open doubles title, defeating the Netherlands' Arianne Hartono and Indian hope Prarthana Thombare 6-4, 6-3 in 1 hour and 25 minutes.

Jakupovic and Santamaria converted five of their seven break points in the final. Jakupovic has now won five WTA 125 doubles titles, while Santamaria claimed the second WTA 125 doubles title of her career.

		Transylvania Open:Cluj-Napoca,Romania : Feb 5 - Feb 11,2024

			<p>
Former World No.1 Karolina Pliskova ended a four-year title drought by winning the Transylvania Open championship in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.


 Pliskova defeated Romanian hope and No.8 seed Ana Bogdan 6-4, 6-3 in 1 hour and 25 minutes to capture her 17th career WTA singles title -- and her first since January of 2020, when she won the Brisbane International title for the third time.

Coming into this week's WTA 250 event, two-time Grand Slam finalist Pliskova had not reached a WTA singles final since August of 2021, when she finished as Montreal runner-up to Camila Giorgi.

Pliskova, who spent eight weeks ranked World No.1 in 2017, was still inside the Top 20 at this time last year. But her current ranking is No.78, and she was an unseeded player in her Cluj-Napoca tournament debut. 

 Pliskova eased into the final without the loss of a set. She brought a 3-0 head-to-head record against Bogdan into Sunday's clash, and Pliskova was ultimately able to maintain her undefeated record against the home hope.


 Bogdan, who was seeking her first career WTA singles title, and on home soil to boot, got off to the perfect start as she built an early 3-0 lead. However, Pliskova began to find her top form as she pulled back on serve at 3-2 with a forehand winner down the line.

Pliskova saved two break points in the next game to remain on serve, then prevailed in a grueling ninth game, converting her fifth break point of that battle to serve for the set at 5-4. Pliskova fired two aces to reach triple set point and closed out the love hold with a forehand winner.

Pliskova kept control in the second set, where she broke Bogdan twice and never faced a break point. The former World No.1 slammed one final forehand winner to convert her second match point and hoist another championship trophy in her prolific career.

Pliskova won 29 of 37 first-service points in the match (78 percent), and she erased three of the four break points she stared down, all in the opening set.


 The all-American duo of Caty McNally and Asia Muhammad won the Transylvania Open doubles title. McNally and Muhammad defeated Harriet Dart of Great Britain and Slovakia's Tereza Mihalikova 6-3, 6-4 in 1 hour and 18 minutes.

This week was the first time McNally and Muhammad had ever partnered up on tour, and it resulted in McNally's eighth career WTA doubles title, and the ninth career WTA doubles title for Muhammad.

		Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open:Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates :Feb 5 - Feb 11,2024
		<img src="Abu Dhabi Open.jpg" alt=" Abu Dhabi" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

World No.5 Elena Rybakina captured her second title of the season after easing past No.14 Daria Kasatkina 6-1, 6-4 in the final of the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open on Sunday. Abu Dhabi is Rybakina's seventh career title on the Hologic WTA Tour and fourth on a hard court. 

Seeded No.1 at a tournament for the second time in her career, Rybakina enjoyed a winning week in Abu Dhabi, which included wins over Danielle Collins, Cristina Bucsa and No.8 seed Liudmila Samsonova. 


Rybakina moved to 11-2 on the season, having won her first title of the year in Brisbane last month. She is tied with Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka for the second-most wins on tour behind Jelena Ostapenko's tour-leading 13 wins.

Despite Sunday's loss, Kasatkina has engineered a strong start to the season. Abu Dhabi was her second final of the nascent season. She made her first in Adelaide in January. With a 9-4 record, Kasatkina ranks No.6 on the tour in match wins this year.

Both players will immediately head to Doha for the first WTA 1000 tournament of the season at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open. While Rybakina has a bye into the second round, Kasatkina is scheduled to play her first-round match against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Monday evening. 




Rybakina raced through the opening set quickly, aided in part by Kasatkina's 16 unforced errors. Kasatkina, 26, was coming off a three-hour effort to get past Beatriz Haddad Maia in the semifinals. But with Rybakina landing 86 percent of her first serves, Kasatkina could find no inroads in the 25-minute set.

In the second set, Kasatkina smartly threw caution to the win and amped her baseline aggression. After striking just two winners in the first set, Kasatkina grew more opportunistic in the second set and reeled in Rybakina to level at 4-4.

But Rybakina snuffed out Kasatkina's surge with a blistering return game to break for a fifth and final time to 5-4. After a brief rain interruption as Rybakina served at 5-4, 30-all, the 2022 Wimbledon champion resumed play and coolly served out the win.

Rybakina finished the match with 17 winners to 12 unforced errors. Kasatkina hit 14 winners to 27 unforced errors, including nine double faults. 

The victory improved Rybakina's record against Kasatkina to 3-2. She has won their last two matches.



 Sofia Kenin and Bethanie Mattek-Sands took home the doubles title, defeating Linda Noskova and Heather Watson 6-4, 7-6(4) in the final. The title is Mattek-Sands' 29th career doubles title and first since 2023 Seoul. It is just the third doubles title for Kenin and the first since she won 2019 Beijing with Mattek-Sands.

			CORDOBA OPEN:Cordoba, Argentina:5 - 11 February,2024
		<img src="Cordoba Open.jpg" alt="Argentina" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

Italian qualifier Luciano Darderi capitalised on a nervous and flat performance from home hope Facundo Bagnis to capture his first ATP Tour title in the Cordoba Open final Sunday.

Perhaps overwhelmed by the chance to win his maiden title at age 33, Bagnis won just 12 of the first 47 points of the match as 21-year-old Darderi raced to a 6-1, 2-0 lead in just 34 minutes, silencing Argentine fans in the process.



In just the third all-qualifier final since the ATP Tour was established in 1990, Darderi took advantage of an error-laced performance from the World No. 207, who has appeared in 30 ATP Challenger Tour finals but just one tour-level final before Sunday, to run out a 6-1, 6-4 winner.


After the match seemed over early in the second set, Bagnis reclaimed the break and eventually led 4-3 before fatigue appeared to play a factor in him surrendering the decisive break in a six-deuce penultimate game of the match.

Darderi, who had just one tour-level match win to his credit before this week, is projected to surge from No. 136 to No. 76 in Monday’s Pepperstone ATP Rankings. Last week he lost in the second round of the ATP Challenger Tour event in Punta del Este, Uruguay.

Born in Argentina but an Italian national, Darderi is coached by his father, Luciano.

			Dallas Open:Dallas,Texas:5 - 11 February,2024
		<img src="Dallas.jpg" alt="Texas" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
A big goal for Team Tommy Paul entering the 2024 season was to win more titles. The American accomplished just that on Sunday.

Paul defeated countryman Marcos Giron 7-6(3), 5-7, 6-3 to lift the Dallas Open trophy. It is the 26-year-old’s second ATP Tour title and first since 2021 in Stockholm.




The first all-American tour-level final since Tokyo two years ago was a back-and-forth battle on the campus of Southern Methodist University. But Paul secured an immediate break in the deciding set and never relinquished his advantage.

When Giron missed a final return in the deuce court, Paul turned towards coach Brad Stine and girlfriend Paige Lorenze, held his arms out in celebration, allowed a smile to take over his face and unleashed one big fist pump. He clinched the championship after two hours and 33 minutes.


Giron entered the final with plenty of momentum after earning back-to-back Top 20 wins against top seed Frances Tiafoe and fourth seed Adrian Mannarino. When the former UCLA college star clawed through the second set, it seemed he might use the momentum to secure his first ATP Tour title.

But Paul was slightly better under pressure, and that made all the difference. According to Infosys ATP Stats, the second seed saved four of the six break points he faced and converted his two opportunities.



Paul on Monday will climb to No. 14 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings, making him the No. 2 American behind Taylor Fritz.

			Marseille Open:Marseille,France:5 - 11 February,2024
		<img src="Marseille.jpg" alt="France" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Ugo Humbert won his fifth ATP Tour title Sunday at the Open 13 Provence.

Taking on the in-form Grigor Dimitrov in the championship match in Marseille, Humbert powered to a 6-4, 6-3 victory with a near-flawless performance of precise serving and rock-solid baseline play to become the seventh Frenchman to lift the title at the indoor ATP 250.


A first set dominated by serve saw no break point until the 10th game. Humbert let slip his first opportunity to take the set at 5-4, 40/A on Dimitrov’s serve but made no mistake with the second as his relentlessness from the back of the court helped him move ahead.

After then saving two break points to hold in the opening game of the second set, Humbert raced to a 3-0 lead and barely looked back as he wrapped a deserved victory in which he won 87 per cent (33/38) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

With his 84-minute victory, Humbert also became the eighth player in the Open Era to win his first five tour-level finals. The 25-year-old, who had lost to Dimitrov in both of the pair’s previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings, will also on Monday rise to a new career-high of No. 18 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings as a result of his latest title run.


Tomas Machac and Zhang Zhizhen’s fledgling partnership bagged an early title Sunday, when the pair completed an impressive title run at the Open 13 Provence in Marseille.

Having reached the Australian Open semi-finals on team debut last month, Machac and Zhang eased past Patrik Niklas-Salminen and Emil Ruusuvuori 6-3, 6-4 to lift the trophy at the indoor ATP 250 in France. Machac and Zhang saved all six break points they faced in their 67-minute championship-match triumph to improve to 8-1 as a team.

With the win, Machac became the first Czech player to win an ATP Tour doubles title since Jevaby in Cordoba in 2019, while Zhang continues to break new ground for his country. The 27-year-old Zhang, who is the first Chinese player to have broken the Top 50 of the Pepperstone ATP Rankings in singles, is the first ATP Tour doubles champion from his nation.

				UTS:Oslo,Norway:9-11 February,2024
				<img scr"Oslo.jpg" alt="Norway" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">	
				<p> 
				Andrey Rublev has become the first two-time champion in UTS history as he lifted the lightning-bolt trophy in Oslo.

Rublo defeated Alex “The Demon” de Minaur 14-16, 17-10, 16-13, 20-12 to add the UTS Oslo title to the one he won in Frankfurt last year.


It also means he punches his ticket to the 2024 UTS Grand Final later this year – with de Minaur currently in second place in the Race Ranking on 15 points. The UTS Grand Final will be the fourth event this year, two other ones being due to happen in the USA in August and in Europe in October.


It was the first time that two former UTS champions had met beyond the Final Four. However, The Demon and Rublo had already played each other in Oslo during the round-robin stage, another match in which Rublev had to come back from a quarter down, winning on that occasion 13-15, 18-10, 17-14, 17-12.

This time round, Rublo won 67 points against The Demon’s 51 – despite de Minaur taking full advantage of all three bonus cards he played compared to Rublev’s two out of three.

The first quarter was very close, with both players recording exactly the same percentages on serve and return points won – 57 and 43 respectively. While de Minaur’s serve was marginally the faster, 155kph compared to Rublev’s 140 kph, he was also slightly less accurate, with 93 per cent of serves in – Rublo got all of his in.

Rublev knew he needed to step it up, and he did, dominating the percentages on serve and return from then on; an overall 60 per cent of points won on serve is an impressive statistic to take away. The rallies were long and the points were quick – Rublo averaging just five seconds to win a point.

And despite de Minaur’s brilliant use of the crosscourt forehand, catching Rublo unawares on multiple occasions, it was the Frankfurt champion who came up with the goods and got over the finish line.


Earlier in the day, de Minaur had got the first win of the day as he crushed home hopes by defeating Casper “The Ice Man” Ruud 15-9, 17-9, 14-10 in the Final Four.

And Rublo followed that up to secure his own place in the title match with a stunning win over Alexander Bublik, The Bublik Enemy – racking up a huge 76 points across three quarters to win 25-11, 25-12, 26-11.



Almost 12.000 fans attended the show, with 3800 tickets sold on Friday and 4000 per day on Saturday and Sunday.				</p>
