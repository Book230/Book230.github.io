				IEB+ Argentina Open:Buenos Aires, Argentina: November 27 -December 3, 2023
		<img src="Buenos Aires.jpg" alt="Buenos" style="width:500px;height:200px;">
			<p>
  No.5 seed Laura Pigossi of Brazil took home the WTA 125 IEB+ Argentina Open title with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over No.8 seed Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina in Sunday's final. It is the first WTA 125 title of Pigossi's career.

World No.137 Pigossi took 1 hour and 32 minutes to topple 175th-ranked Carle on the Argentine's home soil. Pigossi is now 3-0 against Carle in their head-to-head, with all three of the Brazilian's victories coming in straight sets.

Pigossi adds her highest-level career singles title to her list of accomplishments. The 29-year-old was a Hologic WTA Tour singles finalist at 2022 Bogota, and she won an Olympic bronze medal in women's doubles alongside Luisa Stefani at Tokyo 2021.





The singles final was only the beginning of a very busy and ultimately triumphant Sunday for Carle. After losing in the singles final, Carle came back on court and won a delayed doubles semifinal alongside Despina Papamichail. They beat No.1 seeds Diane Parry and Valeriya Strakhova 6-2, 6-2. 

Shortly after that, Carle and Papamichail won the doubles final, which was Carle's third match of the day. Carle and Papamichail claimed the IEB+ Argentina Open doubles title with a 6-3, 4-6, [11-9] defeat of Maria Paulina Perez Garcia and Sofia Sewing.

Carle and Papamichail had previously been the doubles runners-up at Buenos Aires in 2021. This is Carle's first WTA 125 doubles title, and Papamichail's second. Papamichail won WTA 125 Barranquilla earlier this year alongside her fellow Greek Valentini Grammatikopoulou.

			 Creand Andorra Open:Andorra: November 27- December 3 , 2023

		<p> 
		
No.6 seed Marina Bassols Ribera claimed her second WTA 125 title of 2023 at the Creand Andorra Open, defeating Erika Andreeva 7-5, 7-6(3) to win the final in 2 hours and 30 minutes.

No.145-ranked Bassols Ribera has excelled at this level throughout the season, reaching the Valencia final in June (falling to Mayar Sherif) before picking up her first career WTA 125 trophy in Ljubljana in September -- both on clay. Her title run in Andorra featured two victories over former Top 20 players: in the quarterfinals, she saved two match points to come through 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 over wild card Anastasija Sevastova, and in the semifinals she defeated No.8 seed Aliz√© Cornet 6-4, 6-2.


The 23-year-old Spaniard narrowly eked out a title match full of incremental momentum shifts that was tightly contested to the very end. Ultimately, her proficiency in both offense and defense won out: Bassols Ribera started the match with a flurry of winners from all parts of the court, and took control of the second-set tiebreak with a pair of brilliant forehand winners on the run.






The doubles crown went to the all-teenage duo of Andreeva and Naef, who defeated No.2 seeds Babos and Watson 6-2, 6-1 in the final to claim a maiden WTA 125 trophy each.

Andreeva and Naef were teaming up for the first time.

				Next Gen Atp Finals , Jeddah , Saudia Arabia : November 28- December 2 , 2023. 
		<img src=" Next Gen.jpg" alt=" Davis " style="width:500px;height:200px;" 
		<p> 
		Beaming from ear to ear, Hamad Medjedovic was proud of his achievements on Saturday in Jeddah, where he reflected on winning the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by NEOM title. The 20-year-old Serbian defeated Arthur Fils in the title match.



Medjedovic is the sixth champion in the tournament's history, a list that includes Top 10 stars Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Stefanos Tsitsipas. The 20-year-old is delighted to join such elite company and hopes it will help him push on further in 2024 as he aims to break the Top 100 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings for the first time.




Saturday's triumph meant it was a clean sweep for Serbia at the ATP Tour's year-end events after Novak Djokovic captured his record seventh Nitto ATP Finals title in Turin earlier this month.
Medjedovic is pleased to have delivered more success for Serbia.



The Next Gen ATP Finals was the first ever ATP Tour sanctioned event to be held in Saudi Arabia. Medjedovic enjoyed playing in front of the energetic crowds in the King Abdullah Sports City.
