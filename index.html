							The WTA is the women's tennis organization. The WTA was created in 1973 by the Original 9 . The Original 9 included Billie Jean King , Rosie Casals, , Nancy Richey, Kerry Melville, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kristy Pigeon, Judy Dalton, Valerie Ziegenfuss and Julie Heldman. These women fought for equal prize money ,tournaments , and  equal rights for women in the tennis world . If it weren't for them professional women's tennis players today wouldn't be able to play the same amount of tournaments as men , the top players wouldn't be able to earn millions of dollars , and they wouldn't be able to play the sport that they adore at a professional level.
