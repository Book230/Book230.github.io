Caroline has just come back last season after taking a little break from the tour. Caroline was a former world number 1 and had won the Australian Open. Coming into the tournament, Caroline hadn't had such great results and had only won 1 match. In the 1st round, she played Zhu Lin of China  and beat her 7-6,6-1. In the 2nd round,she beat number 25th seeded Donna Vekic of Croatia 7-6,6-3. In the 3rd round, she beat wildcard Katie Volynets of the U.S.A. 6-2,4-6,6-0. In the 4th round, she beat fellow mother Angelique Kerber of Germany 6-4,6-2. In the quarter finals, she played Iga Swiatek and had to pull out due to injury. Overall, this event was crucial for Caroline's confidence and should allow her to do amazing things for the rest of the season.

							ATP player for 3/3 to 3/10/24: Luca Nardi
							</h5> 
								<img src="Luca Nardi.jpg" alt="Czech" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
							<p class="card-text">
							Luca was a very good junior and has started to find his place on the ATP tour. Prior to the tournament, he had made a final of a tournament in Chennai, India and lost in the second round in Bengaluru,India. Luca had to play the qualies of this tournament and had lost in the 2nd round to David Goffin of Belgium 6-7,7-5,4-6. Luca actually ended up getting into the tournament due to a recent withdrawl of Thomas Martin Etcheverry of Argentina. In his 1st round of the main draw or the 2nd round, he beat Zhizhen Zhang of China 6-3,3-6,6-3. In the 3rd round, he upset top seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia 6-4,3-6,6-3 for the biggest win of his young career. In the 4th round, he ended up losng to the American Tommy Paul of the U.S.A. in straight sets 4-6,3-6. Honestly,this tournament was a major confidence boaster for Luca and has allowed him to reach the top 100 for the 1st time.
