Italian Open: Rome, Italy:May 6th- May 19th, 2024


		<img src="Rome Open.jpg" alt="Italy" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Italian hopes Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini thrilled the home crowd at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Sunday with a gritty 6-3, 4-6 [10-8] victory over No.3 seeds Coco Gauff and Erin Routliffe in the doubles final.


On the red clay of Center Court at the Foro Italico, the final went down to the last moment before the unseeded tandem of Errani and Paolini finished off the upset after 1 hour and 28 minutes of play, clinching the WTA 1000 title in Rome.

Title totals rising: Errani and Paolini are the first Italians to claim the women's doubles title in Rome since 2012, when Errani paired with her compatriot Roberta Vinci to prevail. Errani and Vinci also made the Rome final in 2013 and 2014.

It is Errani and Paolini's second team title of the season and third overall. They had already teamed up to take championship trophies at WTA 250 Linz in February and WTA 250 Monastir last season.


Former WTA Doubles World No.1 Errani -- who won the Career Doubles Grand Slam with Vinci -- collected her milestone 30th doubles title in her nation's biggest city. For Paolini, this is her fourth doubles title, three of those coming alongside Errani.

Both of this year's clay-court WTA 1000 titles have gone to home-soil pairings. Prior to Errani and Paolini's triumph in the Italian capital, Spaniards Cristina Bucsa and Sara Sorribes Tormo captured the Mutua Madrid Open in their own capital city.

Narrow margin: On Sunday, the first set quickly went the Italians' way, as they powered to a double-break lead at 5-2 and held on from there. Each team had nine winners in the opener, but Errani and Paolini had only five unforced errors, while their opponents had double that amount.

Gauff of the United States and New Zealand's Routliffe rebounded in the second set. On deciding point at 3-3, a crosscourt rally between Gauff and Errani went the American's way, sealing the pivotal break and propelling the showdown towards the decisive match-tiebreak.


Stronger net play by the No.3 seeds gave them an early 4-1 lead in the match-tiebreak, but costly double faults by both Gauff and Routliffe assisted the Italians in their comeback to 5-5.

A Routliffe smash put her team back ahead 8-6, but Errani and Paolini refused to yield. At 8-8, Routliffe sent a forehand down the line just wide, giving the Italian pair championship point.

The earlier double faults presaged the conclusion, when Gauff hit her team's sixth double fault on championship point. Errani and Paolini hoisted the trophy after going a perfect 4-for-4 on break points and firing 20 winners to just 11 unforced errors.			</p>
ROME -- Serving for the first set in Saturday’s Internazionale BNL d'Italia final, Iga Swiatek hit her only double fault of the match.


She looked more surprised than angry, but there was a controlled fury in the strokes that immediately followed. After missing her first serve at 15-all, she hammered one to Aryna Sabalenka’s body and it was not returned. Two more heavy first serves did not come back and Swiatek was on her way to another emphatic victory on red clay.

Anyone can function nicely in good times -- but how do you deal with pressure and adversity? There’s no one better at the moment than the No.1-ranked Swiatek, a nerveless 6-2, 6-3 winner over No.2 Sabalenka.

With the match still open to suggestion in the second game of the second set, Swiatek fended off five break points to stay even. She was 7-for-7 for the match and 18-for-19 in her past three -- against terrific players.


“Overall, I try to treat these points as any other point,” Swiatek said. “I’m not feeling like I’m under so much pressure. Maybe also because I know I'm a great returner, even if I’m going to get broken, I can work it out.

“I think on this tournament, my serve was kind of really helping me. All this work that we’ve been putting [in] actually paid off in those important moments.”

In a span of 23 days, Swiatek has won the Madrid Open for the first time and followed it up with her third title in Rome. It is now more than possible to imagine -- wasn’t it always? -- that she will capture the Triple Crown in a few weeks at Roland Garros. Swiatek’s won there three times in the past four years and will be the overwhelming favorite to score four of five.


It’s only happened once in Hologic WTA Tour history and, of course, it was Serena Williams achieving that fabulous feat, in 2013.

In advance of this event, two-time Rome champion Elina Svitolina was asked if Swiatek, based on her history, could put together these titles back-to-back-to-back.

“Yeah,” Svitolina said, after briefly pondering the question. “She lives to play on clay, obviously, winning multiple times at Roland Garros.

“It’s a great lineup for her for this year. She’s playing really well, so it’s going to be tough to beat her in these events.”

Martina Navratilova, a two-time singles winner and seven-time doubles champion at Roland Garros, said there wasn’t any reason that Swiatek wouldn’t triumph in Paris.

“No, not really,” Navratilova said. “She’s been Chris Evert-like. That topspin drives you nuts, and I think she moves as good as anybody. Clay, she’s got that down to perfection, the sliding and the movement and recovery.

“Just wears you out from the baseline, playing aggressive. She’s got the consistency and the major wins. That’s why she’s been No.1 for so long. Paris is the perfect venue for her game.”

Swiatek is relentlessly aggressive. She had Sabalenka constantly on the run. Too often a point ended with Sabalenka stretching and out of position, impatiently trying to hit shots with a high degree of difficulty instead of taking something off the ball.

Here is precisely what that pressure feels like:

“I know that she’s moving well and I have to stay aggressive, I have to keep pushing,” Sabalenka said. “There is little chance that she’s going to give me an easy point. Maybe knowing that, it makes me rush things a little bit.



“I guess that’s what I’m going to try to do differently next time when I’m playing against her, not rush things, trust my game, and know that I don’t have to overdo stuff to get those key points.”

You have to feel for Sabalenka, who flashed several wry smiles during another classy speech at the trophy presentation. She’s had a lot of practice. In a little over two years, Swiatek has beaten her five times of six on clay -- five in finals.

Sabalenka came into the event under the weather and persevered through congestion, a sore throat and a lower back injury -- she saved three match points against Svitolina -- that cast doubt over her quarterfinal match. Even with all the atmospheric advantages to her game, even with her best stuff, Sabalenka came up short in Madrid’s final in a third-set tiebreak.
“Well,” Swiatek said, “I’m No. 1 so I’m the favorite everywhere if you look at rankings. But rankings don’t play, so ... I’ll do everything step by step and we’ll see.”		
Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos captured their sixth ATP Masters 1000 crown as a team on Sunday at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia, where they defeated Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic 6-2, 6-2.

In a rain-disrupted final, the top seeds were dominant throughout. They won 81 per cent (26/32) of their first-serve points and saved both break points they faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to triumph after 69 minutes. Granollers and Zeballos lead Arevalo and Pavic 2-0 in the teams' Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

"It is always special to win a Masters 1000 title, so we are very happy with the way we played all week," Granollers said. "It was unbelievable how we played."



Granollers and Zeballos, who are joint No. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, have now lifted the trophy in Rome twice, having also won in 2020.

"I think we are like wine," Zeballos said. "We are getting older and we are getting better. We have a lot of confidence and have been playing well the last weeks and year."


The Spanish-Argentine pair was dominant throughout their run in the Italian capital. They did not drop a set, defeating singles stars Alexander Bublik and Ben Shelton in the semi-finals. Granollers, 38, has now won 26 tour-level doubles titles, while Zeballos, 39, has lifted 21.

Granollers and Zeballos are currently second in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. They reached the title match at the Nitto ATP Finals last season.

Alexander Zverev is an ATP Masters 1000 champion for the sixth time.

The German moved past first-time Masters 1000 finalist Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 7-5 on Sunday at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia to win the title in Rome for a second time.

Zverev will climb to No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday, with his Rome title the biggest he has earned since he suffered a catastrophic ankle injury in the Roland Garros semi-finals in 2022. Prior to Sunday, the 27-year-old’s most recent Masters 1000 triumph came in Cincinnati in 2021, while he also lifted the Nitto ATP Finals trophy in the same season.

"Obviously winning my first ever [Masters] here in Rome and winning my first after my injury also in Rome, so Rome is a very special place for me," Zverev said. "It is a very, very special week."

Zverev showed great athleticism to soak up Jarry's big hitting during the one-hour, 41-minute minute clash and he took large cuts off both wings to take time away from the Chilean, who was unable to find the required consistency in crucial moments.

"He is playing huge and you can see by the players he has beaten here this week," Zverev said when asked about Jarry. "Playing incredible tennis. I told him if he continues to play like that he will have many chances at this level. Today I am extremely happy to be the winner."

The 22-time tour-level champion was impressive throughout his run in the Italian capital, where he dropped just one set. The third seed also lifted the trophy at the clay-court event in 2017 when he was just 20 years old.


Competing in his 11th Masters 1000 final and first since Madrid in 2022, Zverev won 95 per cent (37/39) of his first-serve points according to Infosys ATP Stats. He returned with depth and consistency to foil the Chilean’s big serve, improving to 5-2 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Zverev, who committed just eight unforced errors, squandered two match points on Jarry's serve at 5-4, before he eventually sealed victory on his fourth match point.

Jarry was competing in his first Masters 1000 title match, having defeated seeds Stefanos Tsitsipas and Tommy Paul en route. The 28-year-old, who is up to No. 17 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, was the first Chilean to reach a final at this level since Fernando Gonzalez in Rome in 2007.

The 21st seed has won tour-level titles at ATP 250 events in Bastad (2019), Santiago (2023) and Geneva (2023).









				Parma Ladies Open: Parma,Italy:May 13th- May 18th, 2024


		<img src="Parma Open.jpg" alt="Italy" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
No.4 seed Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia battled to the WTA 125 Parma Ladies Open title this week, culminating in a 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 victory over No.8 seed Mayar Sherif of Egypt in Saturday's final.


On the clay courts of northern Italy, Schmiedlova needed 2 hours and 53 minutes to take down Sherif. Schmiedlova, last year's Parma runner-up to Ana Bogdan, went one further this year and took home the second WTA 125 title of her career.

Currently ranked No.67, former Top 30 player Schmiedlova made it into this week's semifinals without the loss of a set. However, the Slovak then had to fight her way through two marathon rounds before hoisting the trophy.

On Friday, Schmiedlova barely outlasted Jule Niemeier 6-4, 6-7(11), 7-5 in a 3-hour and 38-minute semifinal. Schmiedlova had six match points in the second set but was pulled into a third set by Niemeier.


In the third set, Niemeier held six match points of her own serving at 5-4. Schmiedlova fended off all of those match points, and she eventually closed out the semifinal victory on her seventh match point -- which was her first match point of the third set.


Schmiedlova did not have to face any match points in the final, but she did have to fight back from a deficit again. In the third set, Sherif led by a break at 4-2, but Schmiedlova proved her resilience once more, winning the last four games of the showdown.

Sherif had been unstoppable in WTA 125 finals to start her career, winning the first six she contested. However, the Egyptian has lost in two WTA 125 finals this month, also finishing runner-up to Katerina Siniakova in Lleida.


The Parma doubles final also took place on Saturday, where No.1 seeds Anna Danilina and Irina Khromacheva breezed past No.2 seeds Ingrid Gamarra Martins and Elixane Lechemia 6-1, 6-2 in just 64 minutes.

This is the second WTA 125 doubles title for Danilina, who also won last year's US Open mixed doubles title with Harri Heliovaara. It is the third WTA 125 doubles title for Khromacheva.

			Trophee Clarins: Paris, France:May 13th- May 19th, 2024


		<img src="Trophee Clarins.jpg" alt="France" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
On Sunday, No.6 seed Shnaider bested No.1 seed Emma Navarro 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 in the WTA 125 Trophee Clarins final in Paris. Shnaider,ranked World No.62,took 2 hours and 2 minutes to outlast 23rd-ranked Navarro.

It is Shnaider's second career WTA 125 title. She previously won the WTA 125 title at 2022 Montevideo, which was also on clay.

Like Schmiedlova in Parma, Shnaider had a close call before even making the Paris final. She needed a third-set tiebreak to get past qualifier Elsa Jacquemot in the second round.

In Sunday's final, Shnaider powered to third-set leads at 2-0 and 4-2, but Navarro struck back each time. Ultimately, 20-year-old Shnaider successfully fought through a four-deuce game at 5-4, eventually converting her fourth championship point with a forehand winner.


The Trophee Clarins doubles final took place on Saturday, where Asia Muhammad and Aldila Sutjiadi squeaked past Monica Niculescu and Zhu Lin 7-6(3), 4-6, [11-9] to take the title.

Muhammad and Sutjiadi saved a championship point at 9-8 in the match-tiebreak before converting their first chance at 10-9, completing the win in 2 hours and 2 minutes -- the same length as the singles final.

This is Sutjiadi's third WTA 125 doubles title, and her first since 2022. Muhammad has now won five WTA 125 doubles titles, but this is her first on clay.			</p>
