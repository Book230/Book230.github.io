	 Jiri Lehecka notched an early success in his 2024 season by winning his first ATP Tour title at the Adelaide International.

The 22-year-old, who will rise to a career-high No. 23 in Monday's Pepperstone ATP Rankings, is the first Czech titlist since Jiri Vesely won Pune in 2020. A quarter-finalist at last year's Australian Open, Lehecka will next aim at maintaining his form for another strong run at the season's first major. After triumphing in Adelaide, Lehecka caught up with ATPTour.com to discuss his biggest career title and what he is like off court.

			<h3>
				Alejandro Tabilo( Chile) : ASB Classic:January 8 - 13 January, 2024</h3>

   Chilean qualifier Alejandro Tabilo claimed his first tour-level title on Saturday at the ASB Classic with a gritty win against Taro Daniel at the Auckland ATP 250. In a 6-2, 7-5 victory, Tabilo stormed through the opening set before holding off his Japanese opponent's charge in a tense second.


Behind his title run, the 26-year-old lefty has soared 33 places this week in the Pepperstone ATP Live Rankings to No. 49, setting himself up for a Top 50 debut. The first men's singles player to capture his maiden ATP Tour title in 2024, Tabilo will soon be joined by Jiri Lehecka or Jack Draper, who will compete for their first title in the Adelaide final.

The Chilean lost just one set in six Auckland victories, including two qualifying wins. He upset sixth seed and Next Gen ATP Finals runner-up Arthur Fils in the semi-finals to advance to his second ATP Tour final (Cordoba 2022) and made the most of his opportunity in New Zealand.

 


Tabilo's final victory made him the first Chilean to win a hard-court tour-level title since Fernando Gonzalez in 2007 (Beijing) and the third active Chilean singles champion on the ATP Tour alongside Cristian Garin and Nicolas Jarry. He is also the first qualifier to win a tour-level crown since Juan Manuel Cerundolo in 2021 (Cordoba). 

In his first Lexus ATP Head2Head matchup against Daniel, Tabilo powered to the opening set behind four straight games from 2-2, leaning on his big forehand to dictate the baseline rallies. The match tightened in set two as Daniel found his range, hitting several passing shots to create three break points across his first four return games. Tabilo escaped a five-deuce game — the longest of the match — to hold for 4-3 and later battled through two deuces to make it 6-5.

The Chilean, who won 15 of 25 net points in the match, locked in from the baseline to earn the decisive break in the match's final game. He created his first break points of the second set at 0/40, and again relied on his powerful forehand to wrap up the win in one hour, 36 minutes.

				<h3>
				Emma Navarro( U.S.A.) :Hobart International Open: Jan 8 - Jan 13, 2024</h3>

 Rising American Emma Navarro captured the first Hologic WTA Tour title of her career on Saturday, overcoming two-time champion Elise Mertens 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 to win the Hobart International.


In the first Hobart final between the top two seeds since 1998, it was No.2-seeded Navarro who outlasted No.1 seed Mertens in their first career meeting. Navarro needed a grueling 2 hours and 48 minutes to prevail in the first WTA singles final of her burgeoning career.



 Navarro reaches an new apex in what has already been an incredible rise over the past 12 months. The American was ranked No.149 at this time last year but has since skyrocketed to her current career-high ranking of No.31.

The 22-year-old Navarro reached the Auckland semifinals last week before notching her maiden final and title this week in the Tasmanian capital. She is 8-1 this season heading into 2024's first Grand Slam, the Australian Open.

With Saturday's win, Navarro becomes the second straight American to prevail in Hobart, after Lauren Davis won the title last year.

Former World No.12 Mertens, who won back-to-back Hobart titles in 2017 and 2018, suffered a rare loss at this event on Saturday. The Belgian still holds an excellent 15-3 career win-loss record at the tournament.


 Navarro swept through the first set and was up a break on three separate occasions in the second set. However, Mertens broke back immediately each time, then saved six break points in a gritty hold for 5-4. Mertens took the momentum from that game to break Navarro and level the match at one set apiece.

Navarro also broke Mertens two times in the early stages of the third set, but again, the Belgian stayed within touching distance through 5-5. However, Navarro edged ahead for good by cracking a rally forehand to break for 6-5, and she converted her second match point in the next game with a forehand winner down the line.

Navarro had 39 winners to Mertens' 24 in the final. The American held 19 break points in the showdown and converted eight of those chances.

					<h3>
				Diana Shnaider( Russia) :Hua Hin Open: Jan 29 - Feb 4, 2024</h3>

Diana Shnaider captured her first title on the Hologic WTA Tour after defeating defending champion Zhu Linz 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in the final of the Thailand Open on Sunday.


Unseeded in Hua Hin, Shnaider, 19, beat the top three seeds en route to her maiden title, besting top seed Magda Linette, No.2 seed Zhu and No.3 seed Wang Xiyu. 

Shnaider is the second teenager to win a WTA title this season, joining World No.3 Coco Gauff. The 19-year-old American started her season with a successful title defense in Auckland. 

A standout at North Caroline State last year, Shnaider will surge back into the Top 100 on Monday.

 Shnaider finished her breakout 2023 season at a career-high ranking of No.60. But she came into Hua Hin ranked No.108 and searching for her first win of the season. In January, she went 0-3 across Brisbane, Hobart, and the Australian Open.

Yet despite winning just one set last month, Shnaider tore through the Hua Hin draw and won all but two of the sets she played through the week. With Sunday's victory, Shnaider improved to 2-0 against Zhu. The teenager defeated Zhu in their first meeting last fall, posting a 6-4, 6-0 win in Nanchang.

 Playing in her second WTA final, Shnaider enjoyed a blistering start to take the opening set after 44 minutes. She overpowered Zhu from the baseline and was efficient on her break chances, converting the two break points she earned to hand the Chinese veteran her first set-loss of the week. 

Zhu turned the tables in the second set by taking advantage of a marginal dip in form from Shnaider. Zhu ran off four consecutive games to force the big-hitting final into a deciding set.


But after a lengthy set break, Shnaider returned to court with a renewed purpose. She quickly reset to break Zhu at love with a flurry of jaw-dropping baseline winners and consolidated the break to lead 2-0. Shnaider did not relent. Battering backhands from the baseline, she broke Zhu for a second break to lead 4-1 and then, using her court coverage and touch, closed out the milestone victory with a stunning backhand winner.

 Shnaider was perfect on break point conversions, breaking on all five of her opportunities. She also dominated Zhu's second serve, limiting the Chinese veteran to a 37.1% win rate. In contrast, Shnaider won 63.6% of her second-serve points.
