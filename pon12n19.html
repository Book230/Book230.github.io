Additionally, she had won 3 titles on the ITF tour. The ITF tour is below the WTA tour and has the lower ended players. Sara had won one of these titles right before the tournament, which gave her a lot of confidence. At the Colina Open, she played 5 matches and beat 3 seeded opponents. In the 1st round, she beat 6th seeded Anna Bondar of Hungary 5-7, 6-2, 6-3.  In the second round, she beat Ekaterine Gorgodze of Georgia 6-1, 6-2. In the quarter finals, she beat Panna Udvardy of Hungary 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. In the semi finals, she beat Nadia Podoroska of Argentina 6-0, 4-6, 6-2. In the final, she beat Diane Parry of France 6-2, 6-1. As a result, Sara was able to clinch her first ever WTA 125 title and reached her career high of 134 in the world.
