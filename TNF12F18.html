Qatar Total-Energies Open:DOHA, QATAR Feb 11 - Feb 17,2024
		<img src=" Qatar.jpg" alt="Doha" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
				
World No.1 Iga Swiatek won the year's first WTA 1000 title at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open on Saturday, and became the first player in nearly nine years to win a Hologic WTA Tour event three consecutive times.


Swiatek fought past World No.4 Elena Rybakina 7-6(8), 6-2 to notch her 12th straight win at the Doha event, battling back from a double-break down in the first set and saving a set point in the tiebreak. Swiatek claimed her 18th career singles title, and her first of the 2024 season.

Before this week, the most recent player to win a WTA tournament three times in a row was longtime World No.1 Serena Williams, when the American claimed her third straight Miami Open title in 2015.

But the current World No.1 from Poland matched that feat with her three-peat in Doha. Swiatek now holds a 13-1 career win-loss record at the Qatar TotalEnergies Open; her only loss at this event was in the 2020 second round to Svetlana Kuznetsova.


On Saturday, squeaking out the 90-minute opening frame also kept Swiatek's set-winning streak at the tournament alive. Swiatek has now won 23 sets in a row in Doha; her last set lost at the event was the second set of her 2022 opening-round clash against Viktorija Golubic.

Swiatek snapped a three-match losing streak to Rybakina on Saturday, defeating the Kazakh for just the second time in their five tour-level meetings.

Despite this loss, Rybakina exits Doha as the season leader in match-wins, with 15 so far. She has surpassed Jelena Ostapenko, who has won 14 matches in 2024. Rybakina and Ostapenko are the only players to have won multiple singles titles so far this year, with two apiece.


In a grueling first set, Rybakina broke Swiatek twice to lead 4-1, but the No.3 seed had to stop in the middle of that game for a medical time-out after she accidentally cut her leg with her racquet at the end of her service motion.

After that, Swiatek pulled back to level footing at 4-4, but Rybakina regrouped by breaking the top seed for 6-5, grabbing a chance to serve out the set. Swiatek's overheads helped her break Rybakina once more, sending the set into a tiebreak.
			In the decisive breaker, heavy hitting by both led to an 8-8 deadlock, after three set points for Swiatek and one for Rybakina went begging. However, a rally backhand winner by Swiatek gave the World No.1 her fourth set point at 9-8, and that one was converted with a passing winner off the backhand side.

Swiatek had to save two break points in her first service game of the second set, but after getting out of that jam, she eased to victory. Swiatek finished the match with six more winners and four fewer unforced errors than Rybakina, and the top seed converted half of her ten break points.


 No.5 seeds Demi Schuurs of the Netherlands and Luisa Stefani of Brazil claimed the Qatar TotalEnergies Open doubles title with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over unseeded Americans Caroline Dolehide and Desirae Krawczyk.

In only their second event as a partnership, Schuurs and Stefani captured the WTA 1000 title in a 77-minute final, and improved their team record to 8-1 this year.

Earlier in the week, Schuurs and Stefani ousted No.1 seeds and reigning Australian Open champions Hsieh Su-wei and Elise Mertens in the quarterfinals. That avenged their sole team loss of the season, which came in the quarterfinals at this year's first Grand Slam.

This is Schuurs' 18th career WTA doubles title, and her fifth WTA 1000 crown (Schuurs' first WTA 1000 title since 2020). Stefani is up to nine WTA doubles titles in her career, with three of those coming at WTA 1000 events.

			Delray Beach Open:Delray Beach,Florida : Feb 12 - Feb 18,2024
		<img src="Delray Beach Open.jpg" alt="Delray" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>
Taylor Fritz faced plenty of obstacles at the Delray Beach Open — wind, rain and close friend Tommy Paul among them. But nothing was able to stop the top seed from successfully defending his trophy.

Fritz defeated Paul 6-2, 6-3 on Monday to become just the second player in tournament history to win the event two years in a row, joining Jason Stoltenberg, who accomplished the feat in 1996 and 1997. The final was delayed by a day due to rain and it was windy throughout the week, but Fritz persevered.

"I had a long list of things I needed to do well, but I think a lot of that went out the window when we realised the conditions for the match, [that it was] going to be so windy," Fritz said. "On both sides, I had different ideas of what I wanted to do because [I was] just limited with the wind. I tried to serve as best I could, which it got me out of some trouble. I started to find it at the end. But it's incredibly tough to play, do what you want to do when it's windy like this.”


The champion has now won six consecutive ATP Tour finals dating back to the start of the 2022 season. This is the first time he has successfully defended a title, and he did it without losing a set.

The finalists arrived on Stadium Court tied at 2-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. But Fritz was in control for almost the entirety of their clash.



At 3-3 in the second set, Paul spent more than 15 minutes trying to break Fritz’s serve. But Fritz held firm as he did throughout the match. He saved all seven break points he faced in the encounter according to Infosys ATP Stats. 

The top seed then broke Paul’s serve in the next game and held to love to clinch the championship.

“I think there were some questions about how I was physically feeling,” Fritz said. “I didn't play one of the rubbers at Davis Cup. I wasn't feeling amazing after Australia, so it's great to come here and feel like I'm moving and physically I'm definitely there and can keep playing.

“I don't need to take any time off to recover and mentally, it was tough conditions, especially today. I kind of just powered through it. All the pressure was on me this week defending the title and I was able to get through it.”

Paul was trying to win a title for the second consecutive week after triumphing at last week's Dallas Open. The 26-year-old has won seven of his past eight matches.

In the eight matches Fritz has won in Delray Beach during his two title runs, the American has lost just one set. That came in last year's final against Miomir Kecmanovic.
				Julian Cash and Robert Galloway claimed their first ATP Tour title on Monday when they emerged victorious at the Delray Beach Open.

The British-American duo needed to wait an extra day to play the championship match due to rain Sunday in Florida. But the third seeds made it well worth their wait, rallying past top seeds Santiago Gonzalez and Neal Skupski 5-7, 7-5, 10-2 to lift the trophy.

“It's been an unbelievable week,” Galloway said. “I love playing in Delray and playing with Julian has been special. We hope to be in a couple more finals, so it isn't going to be our last one hopefully. But to take advantage of our first one is great.”

Cash and Galloway played together for the first time last year in Atlanta, where they made the semi-finals. Seven months later, they are ATP Tour champions.

Cash had lost his first three tour-level doubles final, and this was Galloway’s first appearance in an ATP Tour championship match.

“I had three finals and came up short, so obviously [that] adds a little bit of pressure to the next one,” Cash said. “But delighted to come through and feels great to get the win.”

The champions converted four of their six break points according to Infosys ATP Stats. They also lost serve four times.

“It took a lot for everyone to adjust I think and there were so many breaks out there,” Cash said. “We just kept plugging away. Despite maybe not feeling that good the score was staying close. Once we got that break in the second set we were full steam ahead.”

Gonzalez and Skupski both competed in last year’s Nitto ATP Finals with different partners. This is their first season as a team and they were trying to earn their first title together.

			ABN AMRO OPEN:Rotterdam,Netherlands:Feb 12 - Feb 18,2024
		<img src="Rotterdam Open.jpg" alt=" Rotterdam" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>


The Italian captured his second tour-level title of the season on Sunday when he defeated Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-4 to win the ABN AMRO Open for the first time.

The 22-year-old produced his trademark style of clean-hitting, aggressive tennis to overpower the Australian in Rotterdam. Sinner struck 23 winners and recovered from squandering a break advantage in both sets to earn his 15th tour-level win in a row after two hours and five minutes. He holds a perfect 7-0 record in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Sinner, who captured his first major crown at the Australian Open last month, will rise to a career-high No. 3 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings on Monday. No Italian man has ever been as high.

Sinner has now won three consecutive ATP 500 events he has played (also Beijing and Vienna at the end of 2023). Following his Aussie Open run, the Italian played with confidence and purpose all week, dropping just one set at the indoor hard tournament for his 12th tour-level title.

The 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals champion has now won 32 of the past 34 matches. His only defeats have come against Ben Shelton in Shanghai and Novak Djokovic in the Nitto ATP Finals title match.

De Minaur will move to a career-high No. 9 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings on Monday. The Australian, who beat Grigor Dimitrov in the semi-finals, holds a 7-8 record in tour-level finals.
In a high-intensity clash, bruising baseline rallies were a common theme throughout the first set. After Sinner gained the break in the opener, he failed to serve out at 5-4, with De Minaur saving four set points to level. However, the Italian would not be denied, breaking immediately in the next game when De Minaur decided to leave a volley that landed in. The Italian then held comfortably to move ahead.

The top seed was made to dig deep at times in the second set against De Minaur, who pushed the Italian to the limit with his flat groundstrokes. However, as has been the case in recent months, Sinner had the answers. Just as in the first set, Sinner was pegged back after gaining the initial break, but he rallied and continued to hit through the fifth seed to win, raising his arms in delight.

Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic won their second title of the season as a team on Sunday at the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam, where they moved past Dutch wild cards Robin Haase and Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3, 7-5.

Dutchman Koolhof and Croatian Mektic overcame top seeds Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek in the semi-finals and backed up that win with an impressive display in the title match to triumph after 85 minutes.

Koolhof and Mektic won 76 per cent (16/21) of their first-serve points in the opening set, before they rallied from a break down in the second set.

The Dutch-Croatian pair is now 10-1 together in 2024, having also won the title in Auckland. It is the first time home favourite Koolhof has won the trophy in Rotterdam, while Mektic clinched the crown in 2021 with Mate Pavic.


The semi-final lineup at the ABN AMRO Open was completed early on Friday after home favourite Wesley Koolhof and his partner Nikola Mektic held firm for a straight-sets win against Alexander Erler and Lucas Miedler at the indoor ATP 500.

Koolhof and Mektic prevailed 6-3, 7-6(5) in 84 minutes at Rotterdam Ahoy to set a last-four Saturday night meeting with top seeds and defending champions Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek. It was a second Lexus ATP Head2Head victory of the season for Koolhof and Mektic against Erler and Miedler — they also defeated the Austrian duo en route to the title in Auckland last month.

The other semi-final in Rotterdam will feature Koolhof’s countrymen Robin Haase and Botic van de Zandschulp. The wild card pairing meets third-seeded Americans Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow on Saturday afternoon.



Ivan Dodig and Austin Krajicek kept alive their ABN AMRO Open title defence by prevailing amid Match Tie-break tension Thursday in Rotterdam.

The top-seeded pair overcame Andreas Mies and John-Patrick Smith 4-6, 6-4, 10-8 to reach the semi-finals at the indoor ATP 500 in the Netherlands. Dodig and Krajicek could only convert one of nine break points they earned but nonetheless held firm for a 97-minute victory.

Dodig and Krajicek, who finished 2023 by clinching the Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by Pepperstone honours for the first time, will take on Alexander Erler/Lucas Miedler or Wesley Koolhof/Nikola Mektic next as they chase their first championship-match appearance of this season.

In the bottom half of the draw, Robin Haase and Botic van de Zandschulp kept home interest in the doubles draw alive by beating Alexander Bublik and Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2 for a semi-final berth. The wild card team will next take on third seeds Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow.

			IEB+ ARGENTINA OPEN:Buenos Aires, Argentina:12 - 18 February,2024
		<img src="Argentina Open.jpg" alt="Argentina" style="width:500px;height:200 px;">
			<p>

Italians Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori won the IEB+ Argentina Open in Buenos Aires on Sunday when they defeated top seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos 6-2, 7-6(6) in the final.

The third seeds saved all three break points they faced to emerge victorious against the 2023 Nitto ATP Finals runners-up. They lost just one set en route to the title.

Bolelli and Vavassori, this year's Australian Open finalists, had been 0-3 in tour-level finals as a team. But they lifted their first trophy as a pair in Buenos Aires.

The Italians are second in the Pepperstone ATP Doubles Teams Rankings, only trailing the duo that beat them in the Australian Open final: Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden.
In Buenos Aires, top seed Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos defeated fourth seeds Marcelo Melo and Matwe Middelkoop 6-3, 6-3 to set up a final showdown with Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori. The third-seeded Italians took out Nicolas Barrientos and Rafael Matos 7-5, 6-3.
Facundo Diaz Acosta will never forget what he accomplished Sunday in Buenos Aires.

The 23-year-old wild card defeated third seed Nicolas Jarry 6-3, 6-4 in the final of the IEB+ Argentina Open to capture his first ATP Tour title.




The Argentine began the week with just four tour-level wins. He earned five this week alone and did not lose a set en route to the trophy at the ATP 250 event. Diaz Acosta joined Rafael Nadal as the only left-handed champions in tournament history.



The home favourite began the week at a career-high No. 87 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings. With his memorable performance in Argentina, he will climb to World No. 59 on Monday.

Jarry entered the final with plenty of momentum after stunning World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz Saturday in the semi-finals. It was the biggest win of the powerful Chilean’s career. 

But the 28-year-old was unable to maintain the same form in the final. The massive blows that were landing in the semis were sailing long or into the net, while Diaz Acosta served as a heavy-hitting backboard in front of his home fans.


The Argentine faithful sang that song repeatedly on Court Guillermo Vilas, pushing Diaz Acosta to dig deep in the biggest match of his career. And that he did. According to Infosys ATP Stats, he saved all six break points he faced to emerge victorious after one hour and 45 minutes.


Jarry showed signs of his best tennis in the second half of the second set and began to limit his errors. But Diaz Acosta treated the court like a chess board, allowing the Chilean to control rallies and waiting for the perfect moment to counterpunch and hit timely winners.

The Argentine found himself in trouble serving at 4-3 in the second set. He faced his first break points since the first game of the match, but Jarry’s backhand proved vulnerable in the critical moments.

Diaz Acosta was made to work when he served for the title. He saved another break point in the final game and finally converted his sixth championship point, dropping his racquet and looking to his team in disbelief with a wide smile.

Diaz Acosta defeated Daniel Altmaier, fourth seed Francisco Cerundolo, Dusan Lajovic, Federico Coria and Jarry to become the sixth Argentine champion in Buenos Aires tournament history.
