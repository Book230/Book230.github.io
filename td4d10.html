No.2 seed Renata Zarazua of Mexico captured the WTA 125 Montevideo Open singles title by edging past No.1 seed Diane Parry 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in Sunday's final.



With the comeback win, 26-year-old Zarazua takes home the first WTA 125 title of her career. She had previously been a runner-up on the hard courts of WTA 125 Concord, losing that final to Magdalena Frech.

Zarazua also moves up to a new career-high ranking of No.105 on Monday.


Zarazua cruised through her first three rounds this week, but she had to survive a battle in Saturday's semifinals. In that clash, Zarazua led Maria Lourdes Carle 4-1 in the third set before Carle surged and served for the match at 5-4. Zarazua rebounded by winning the next three games to advance to the final.




In Saturday's Montevideo Open doubles final, the unseeded all-Argentine pairing of Maria Lourdes Carle and Julia Riera defeated No.4 seeds Freya Christie and Yuliana Lizarazo 7-6(5), 7-5 to claim the title.

Carle and Riera beat three seeded teams on their way to the title, and they did not drop a set in all four of their wins this week. They took 1 hour and 44 minutes to topple Christie of Great Britain and Colombia's Lizarazo in the final.

Carle is on an eight-match winning streak in doubles, having won two WTA 125 doubles titles in a two-week span. Carle won her first career WTA 125 doubles title alongside Despina Papamichail in Buenos Aires last week. As for Riera, this is her first career WTA 125 title.

Number 2 seed Clara Burel came from a set and a break down to defeat Chloe Paquet 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in an all-French final at the Open P2i Angers Arena Loire, lifting her first WTA 125 trophy as a result.

Burel has won nine of her past 10 matches, including a run to the Monastir semifinals in October followed by victories in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals. Burel is currently at a career-high of No.60, and will edge closer to a Top 50 debut on Monday.

A two-time WTA 250 runner-up (Lausanne 2021 and Lausanne 2023), Burel had never previously won a title above ITF W60 level. On home soil, she battled through a trio of three-setters in her last three rounds, including a 7-6(5), 2-6, 6-3 quarterfinal victory over Erika Andreeva, last week's runner-up in the Andorra WTA 125 event.


No.2 seed Clara Burel came from a set and a break down to defeat Chloe Paquet 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in an all-French final at the Open P2i Angers Arena Loire, lifting her first WTA 125 trophy as a result.

Burel has now won nine of her past 10 matches, including a run to the Monastir semifinals in October followed by a victorious outing in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals. The 22-year-old is currently at a career-high of No.60, and will edge closer to a Top 50 debut on Monday.

A two-time WTA 250 runner-up (Lausanne 2021 and Lausanne 2023), Burel had never previously won a title above ITF W60 level. On home soil, she battled through a trio of three-setters in her last three rounds, including a 7-6(5), 2-6, 6-3 quarterfinal victory over Erika Andreeva, last week's runner-up in the Andorra WTA 125 event.


Paquet who is 29, had contested her first WTA 125 final. Her run to the title match featured a 7-5, 6-3 upset of No.1 seed Elisabetta Cocciaretto in the quarterfinals : Paquet's fourth career Top 50 victory, and first since defeating Caroline Garcia in the second round of Jurmala 2019. In the semifinals, Paquet backed that up with another upset, taking out No.3 seed Cristina Bucsa 7-6(3), 6-2.
No.6 seed Dayana Yastremska also reached her third WTA 125 semifinal of the season. The Ukrainian made the last four on clay in Reus in May, then captured the Kozerki title in August. In Angers, she triumphed in a rollercoaster 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(9) quarterfinal over McCartney Kessler, saving one match point in the deciding tiebreak against the 24-year-old American.

No.1 seeds Bucsa and Monica Niculescu claimed the doubles title without dropping a set, defeating No.2 seeds Anna Danilina and Alexandra Panova 6-1, 6-3 in the final. The Spanish-Romanian duo had teamed up for the first time this week.

The trophy was former doubles No.11 Niculescu's first at any level since winning the Limoges WTA 125 in 2021 alongside Vera Zvonareva. Bucsa had captured her first tour-level doubles title in Lyon this February alongside Bibiane Schoofs, and had also previously won two WTA 125 tournaments -- Andorra 2022 with Weronika Falkowska and Contrex√©ville 2023 with Alena Fomina-Klotz.
